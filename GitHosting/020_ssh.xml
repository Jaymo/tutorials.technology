=== The concept of SSH
(((SSH key pair)))
		
			Most Git (and Gerrit) servers support SSH based authentication. This
			requires a
			_SSH key pair_
			for
			automatic authentication.
		
		An SSH key par consists of a public and private key. The public
			key is
			uploaded to the application you want to authenticate with. The
			application has
			no
			access
			to
			the private key. If you interact with
			the
			hosting
			provider via
			the
			ssh
			protocol, the public key is used to
			identify
			a
			user
			who encrypted
			the
			data
			during communication with the
			corresponding
			private key.

=== SSH key pair generation

		
			To create an SSH key under Linux (or Windows / Mac with OpenSSH
			installed) switch to the command line and
			execute
			the following
			commands.
			The generated SSH
			key is by default
			located in the
			<filename class="directory">.ssh`
			directory of the user home directory. Ensure that you backup existing
			keys in
			this directory
			before running the following commands.

			The Eclipse IDE allows you to create an SSH key pair via

			It is good practice to use a
			passphrase to protect your
			private key. It
			is also good practice to
			use
			operating system level permission settings
			to ensure that only
			the
			owning user can access the
			`~/.ssh`
			folder and its content.
		

		<note>
			
				In the above
				`ssh-keygen`
				command the -C parameter is a comment. Using your email is good
				practice so that
				someone looking at your public key can contact you
				in
				case they have
				questions. Including the email enables system
				administrators
				to contact the person in case of questions.
			
		

		
			The result will be two files,
			`id_rsa`
			which is your private key and
			`id_rsa.pub`
			which is your public key.
		

		
			You find more details for the generation of an SSH key on the
			following
			webpages:
			https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">
				GitHub Help: description of SSH key creation
			</ulink>
			or
			http://www.openssh.com/manual.html[OpenSSH manual</ulink>
			.
		
		<tip>
			
				You can specify alternative key names with the
				`-f`
				parameter on the
				command line.
				This is helpful if you have multiple
				different
				repositories and you
				want to have a different key for each
				one. For
				example, you can name
				your SSH keys in domain
				name format,
				e.g.,
				`eclipse.org`
				and
				`eclipse.org.pub`
				as well as
				`github.com`
				and
				`github.com.pub`
				.
			
			
				You need
				additional configuration in the
				`.ssh/config`
				file, because
				only
				the
				`id_rsa`
				will be picked up by
				default. The following code shows an
				example.
