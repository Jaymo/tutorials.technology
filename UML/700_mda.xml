=== Overview</title>
		<para>
			MDA is the approach in which models are automatically
			translated into complete, deployable, running applications.
		</para>
		<para>
			MDA defines several levels for these models, Platform
			independent models, platform specific models and code
			models.
		</para>
	</section>

=== Platform Independent Model (PIM)</title>
		<para>
			Represents the business model to be implemented and can be
			described via UML. The PIM describes the processes of the
			business model and the structure of the system. The PIM does
			not specific operating system, programming language and
			hardware.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="mda_overview_s1s2c">
=== Platform Specific Model (PSM)</title>
		<para>
			The PSM is responsible to specify the technical details to
			implement the PIM, e.g. the operating system, the
			programming language. In case several realizations /
			implementations for a PIM are possible then several PSM are
			formulated.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="mda_overview_s1s2d">
=== Code Mode</title>
		<para>
			Represents the deployable code. In an ideal MDA scenario
			this code could be directly compiled and deployed without
			human interaction.
		</para>
