== Appendix: Class diagrams

[[class_diagramss1s2a]]
=== Overview

A class diagram captures the static relationships of your software.

[[class_diagramss1s2b]]
=== Classes

A class is represented by a rectangular box divided into
compartments.
A Compartment is an area in the box to write
information. The first
compartment holds the
`name`, the second holds the
`attributes`
and the third is used for the
`operations`.

Any compartment can be hidden to improve readability of the diagram.

UML suggests that a class name:

* Starts with a capital letter
* is centered in the top compartment
* is written in a boldface font
* is written in italics if the class is abstract

=== Attributes

Attributes specifies details of a class and can be simple types or objects.

Attributes can be defined inlined (as part second
compartment of
the diagram of the class) or as relationship.

[[class_diagramss1s2bs3a]]
=== Inlined Attributes

Inlined attributes are placed in the second compartment of the class. 
The notation for inline attribute is:
`visibility name: type {multiplicity} {=default}`

=== Attributes by Relationship

To model attributes by relationship you use an
association
relationship between the class which
represents the attribute and the
class containing the
attribute.

[[class_diagramss1s2bs3c]]
=== Static Attributes

Static attributes (attributes that are part of the class
and not
part of the instance of the class) are displayed
via underlining the
name of the relationship.

[[class_diagramss1s2d]]
=== Interfaces

Interfaces are indicated via the stereotype <<interface>>.

Relationships can be expressed via the ball-and-socket notation.

=== Relationships

UML defines several ways of representing relationships between classes.

=== Association

Read as "..has a.." association between classes. Drawn
as a
straight line between the two classes. Does not
mean that the classes
are owned by one, other classes
may use the connected class too.

[[class_diagramss1s2es3b]]
=== Aggregation

Read as "..owns a ..". Not as strong as a composite.

[[class_diagramss1s2es3c]]
=== Composition

Strong relationship between classes to the point of
containment. Read as "..is part of..". If the owning
instance is
destroyed then normally (not necessarily)
the linked object is
destroyed too.

=== Generalisation

Read as ".. is a..". Use to express inheritance.
Represented by
a solid line and a hollow triangular
arrow. For example the following
code could be expressed
with the following diagram.

[source,java]
