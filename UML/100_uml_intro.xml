=== Definition
		
			The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a visual language for
			capturing software designs and patterns. The first version
			of UML was
			defined 1994 and released by the Object
			Management Group (OMG) in 1997
			as UML v.1.1. The syntax and
			a semantic of UML is defined by the OMG.
		
		

			
				The basic building block for UML is a diagram. UML
				divides diagrams
				into
				<emphasis>structural diagrams</emphasis>
				and
				<emphasis>behavioral diagrams</emphasis>
			
			The latest version UML 2 has the target to add the ability
			for
			modelers to capture more system behavior. UML 2 has
			the target to
			support model driving architectures (MDA). MDA
			has the target to
			create automatically a software program
			from several models.

=== UML Profiles
		
			UML is intended to be extended. The formal way to extending
			a UML
			model is via a UML profile. A UML profile a
			collection of UML
			stereotypes and constraints on elements
			that map the generic UML to a
			specific problem domain or
			implementation. For example a UML profile
			can be used to
			support the modeling of J2EE software components.
