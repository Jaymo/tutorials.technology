	[[gmaillabels">
=== Assign automatic labels to emails
		
			If you register to a mailing list you can put the message
			automatically
			into a
			separate folder / label. This following explains
			how
			you can do this.
			For example if you are part of the derby mailing
			list you can put these emails automatically flag with a label via the
			following.
		
		
			Create a label named, for example, "Derby"
		
		
image::gmaillabel1.jpg" />

				</imageobject>

			</mediaobject>
		

		
			Create a filter and add the mail address
			derby-user@db.apache.org to the To field.
			In the "next step" of the
			filter, tick the "Skip
			the Inbox
			(archive it)" check box and the "Apply
			label" checkbox and choose
			"Derby" from the
			dropdown.
			That's it and now
			when you look at your labels list, the
			Derby
			list has it's
			own inbox.
