=== Installation with rbenv

rbenv is a small tool that allows you to install multiple ruby versions and switch between them on the fly.

* https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout and install by cloning the github repository

* https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#installing-as-an-rbenv-plugin-recommended clone for ruby build capabilities

Add this to your bash file (ubuntu: ~/.bashrc) and restart your console:
[source, bash]
----
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
----

Install build dependencies:
[source, terminal]
----
apt-get install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm3 libgdbm-dev
----

You can now build and install the newest ruby version.
[source, terminal]
----
rbenv install 2.3.1
----

You now have to set the default ruby version you'd like to use and you are good to go.
[source, terminal]
----
rbenv global 2.3.1
ruby -v
----
