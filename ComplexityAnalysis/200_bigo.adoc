== The Big O notations

It is common
practice to compare the runtime of
algorithms by
their asymptotic
runtime via the Big O notation. This
notations
describes how the
runtime depends on the number of input
elements. It
answers the
question how much does the runtime increase
if I double the
number of
input elements?

With this notation an algorithm is said to have a O(n) runtime
if the runtime increases linear with the number of input elements. It
has O(n^2) if the runtime increases quadratic, etc.
