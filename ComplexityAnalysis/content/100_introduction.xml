== Introduction
	 Choosing the fastest algorithm for a certain task require
		that you can estimate the runtime of an algorithm. 
	
		The absolute runtime of an algorithm is determined by several things,
		for example:
		
			<listitem>The Hardware it is running upon 
				
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The programming language your are using
				
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				The compiler / runtime environment you are using 
				
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	

	All these factors influence the actual runtime of a algorithm.
	

	
		To compare the runtime behavior of algorithms is important
		to
		have a
		mean to eliminate all these factors and to find a common
		description
		of the runtime.
