	<para> Choosing the fastest algorithm for a certain task require
		that you can estimate the runtime of an algorithm. </para>
	<para>
		The absolute runtime of an algorithm is determined by several things,
		for example:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>The Hardware it is running upon 
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>The programming language your are using
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>The compiler / runtime environment you are using 
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>All these factors influence the actual runtime of a algorithm.
	</para>

	<para>
		To compare the runtime behavior of algorithms is important
		to
		have a
		mean to eliminate all these factors and to find a common
		description
		of the runtime.
