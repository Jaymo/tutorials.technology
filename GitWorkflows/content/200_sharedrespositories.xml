== Git workflows using one shared repository

=== A shared repository between developers
		A very typical Git workflow is that the developers integrate
			their work via a shared remote repository.
			The following section
			describes
			a typical
			Git
			workflow for this scenario.
		
		The shared repository is located on a server so that it can
			easily be reached by each developer.
		
		
			The developers push to this remote repository, typically they use
			the
			remote
			`master`
			branch on the remote repository to integrate their work. They may
			also use different remote branches for shared feature development or
			maintenance releases.
		
		
			The initial setup requires that every developer clones the
			remote
			repository or adds the remote repository as additional remote
			to his local repository.

=== Workflow
(((Git workflow,shared repository)))
		
			To develop a change and integrate it into the shared repository,
			the
			developer would:
		
		
			<orderedlist>
				* 
					Create a new local branch for the development
				
				* 
					Change content in the working tree and add and commit his
						changes
					
				

				* 
					If required he switches to other branches to do other work
					
				
				* 
					Once the development in the branch is complete he rebases (or
						merges) the
						commit history onto the relevant remote-tracking branch
						to allow a
						fast-forward merge for this development
					
				
				* 
					Pushes
						his changes to the remote repository; this results
						in a
						fast-forward merge in the remote repository
					
				
			</orderedlist>
		
		<note>
			Git emphasizes the creation of branches for feature development
				or to create bug fixes.
			
		
		
			During this development he may fetch and merge or rebase the changes
			from
			the remote repository at any point in time. The developer may use
			the
			`pull`
			command instead of the
			`fetch`
			command.

=== Using branches
(((Git workflow,using branches)))
		Even if you have the rights to push to master in a remote
			repository,
			creating a local branch for
			every
			feature or bug fix is a
			good
			practice.
		
		
			Once your development is
			finished you merge your changes to
			your
			master and
			push the changes
			from master to the shared remote Git
			repository.
