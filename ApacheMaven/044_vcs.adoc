== Maven and version control systems

Maven generates its output into the _target_ folder of each project. 
This build output should not get included into your version control system.
	
Add this directory to your ignore resources.
For example, if you use Git as version control system, add the "target/" entry to your _.gitignore_ file in the root of each project.
