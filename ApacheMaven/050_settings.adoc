== Maven settings

Maven allows to define settings on a global, user and project level. 
The common case is to define on a user level, settings like a proxy server or passwords to upload build artifacts to a server.

You can view the file locations in the Eclipse IDE via menu:Windows[Preferences>Maven>User settings].

The following _settings.xml_ file defines a proxy server. 
If this snippet is located in the _.m2_ folder of the users home, Maven uses this proxy.
