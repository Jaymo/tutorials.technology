	<title>Multi module projects (Aggregator)</title>
	Maven supports handling multiple projects. A multi module project
		(aggregator)
		is defined by a parent POM referencing one or more
		projects. This aggregator can contain also the build configuration or
		include another parent POM to get this configuration.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/multiple/pom.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	

	The packaging type of such a POM is pom, as such a project will
		not result in any build output.
