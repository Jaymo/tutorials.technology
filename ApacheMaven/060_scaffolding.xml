	<title>Scaffolding a project with Maven</title>
	
		Maven supports project scaffolding, based on project templates (called
		<wordasword>archtype</wordasword>
		)
		via the
		<wordasword>archetype</wordasword>
		plug-in. A number of
		archetypes are available in Maven for anything
		from a simple application to a
		complex web application,
	
	

		The goal of this scaffolding is to allow a fast start into the
		Maven
		world and supports a "standardized" folder structure of software
		projects.
	
	
		You can create a project by executing the generation
		<wordasword>goal</wordasword>
		on the archetype plugin via the following command:
		<code>mvn archetype:generate</code>
		.
	
	
		This starts the generation process in the interactive mode and
		asks
		you
		for several settings.
