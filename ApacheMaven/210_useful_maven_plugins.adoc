== Useful maven plugins to analyse a project

=== Show the dependency tree

Maven provides a plugin, which can be used to visualize a dependency tree to either the console or an output file.

[source,console]
----
# Show dependencies inside the console
mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose
# Write dependency to a file
mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose -DoutputFile=/home/simon/maven-dependencies
----
[source,xml]
----
include::res/repositories/dependency-tree-pom.xml[]
----
		
The output of the `mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose` command can for example look like the following.

[[maven_versionsplugin]]
=== Versions plugin

The `display-dependency-updates` goal of the _Versions Maven Plugin_ can be used to determine, if there are newer versions of a dependency available.

For example, running `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` for a project might result in the following output.
