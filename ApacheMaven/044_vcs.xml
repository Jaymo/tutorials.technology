	<title>Maven and version control systems</title>

	
		Maven generates its output into the
		<filename>target</filename>
		folder of each project. This build output should not get included into
		your version control system.
	
	
		Add this directory to your ignore resources, e.g., in case you are
		using Git as version control system, add the "target/" entry to your
		<filename>.gitignore</filename>
		file in the root of each project.
