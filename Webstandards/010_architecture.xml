== Web Architecture
	 In a web server architecture you have a web client (browser)
		taking to a web server.
	
	<section id="architecture_web server">
=== Web Server
		 A web server takes a client request, process the request and
			send the result back to the client. The web server may return a HTML
			page, a picture or an error message.
		

		 Web server and web client communicate over a protocol usually
			the HTTP protocol.
		

		 Popular web servers are the Apache HTTP web server.

=== Web Client
		 A web client issues requests (via the user) to the web server
			and displays (renders) the result. A web client is typically a
			browser, e.g. Firefox.

=== HTML
		 HTML is a markup language which contains content and describes
			the structure how this content will be displayed. The current version
			of HTML is HTML5 (which is still work in process). The article
			explains how to develop HTML5 pages.

=== HTTP
		 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol usually used
			for the communication between web server and web client. HTTP is
			based on TCP/IP. TCP is responsible for making sure that a file is
			received as a whole and IP is responsible for moving the individual
			data packages between within the network.
		
		 A HTTP conversion follow a Request / Response sequence. The web
			client issues a request to the web server and the web server
			responses to this request.
		
		
			The HTTP request
			support methods,
			e.g. HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE etc.
			Via
			these methods the web client indicates what the web server should
			do. For example the method GET indicates that the web client would
			like to receive a resource, e.g. file from the web server without any
			modification. The PUT method indicates that the web server should
			change something.
		

		 The HTTP response consists of a response header, and a
			response
			body. The HTTP header contains the status of the response,
			e.g. Ok and
			indicates what type of data is included in the body. The
			type of data
			is also called "Content-Type" or "MIME-type". For
			example the
			"Content-Type: text/htmL" indicates that the response
			body contains
			text or HTML.

	<section id="architecture_url">
=== URL - Uniform Resource Locator
		 A resource in the web (and on the web server) can get
			identified via the URL. A URL is what is usually displayed in the
			browser, e.g. http://www.vogella.com is a URL.
		

		 A URL consists of the following parts:

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/architecture/url.txt" />
			</programlisting>

	<section id="architecture_dns">
=== DNS - Dynamic name server and entries
		 A DNS server is responsible for identifying resources in the
			Internet based on domain names. The provide which hosts and URL can
			specify which DNS server should be used and if someone requests a
			resource with this URL, the name server is contacted to which IP
			address the domain belongs.
		

		To check which entries for a certain domain name is returned, you can use the `digg` command on the command line. f

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/dns/diff.txt" />
