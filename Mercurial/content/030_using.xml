== Mercurial usage with the command line
	[[using_overview">
=== Overview
		 The following will demonstrate a short development cycle
			using
			the
			command line interface of Mercurial.
		
		 You will create a new Mercurial repository, create a new
			Java project and commit the changes to your Mercurial repository.
		
		The command for using Mercurial on the command line is "hg".
	
	[[using_prepare">
=== Prepare
		 Check that you are using Mercurial version 1.3 or higher:
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/version.txt[]
----
		

		 Create and switch to your desired work directory . 

		 Initialize a new Mercurial repository with:
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/clone.txt[]
----
		

		
			<tip>
				If you have an existing project you could clone, e.g. create a
				copy
				of, your repository
				via the following command.

				
					<programlisting>
						<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
							parse="text" href="../examples/using/clone.txt" />
					</programlisting>
				
			
		

		
			Eclipse creates a lot of metadata with regards to the current status
			of the Eclipse workbench. Also Eclipse creates compiled version in
			the directory bin. This data should not be placed in the
			mercurial
			repository. Create the file ".hgignore" in the same directory as
			the
			hg
			project.

	[[using_javaproject">
=== Create Java Project

		Start Eclipse and use the new directory as workspace. Create a
			new Java
			project "de.vogella.mercurial.firstproject". Create the
			following Java
			class.
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/javaproject/Test.java[]

	[[using_commit">
=== Add Project to Mercurial and commit
		 Add the project to Mercurial.  
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/add.txt[]
----
		
		 Commit.  
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/commit.txt[]
----
		

		 If you have checked out the Mercurial project from another site
			you can push your changes to the repository.
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/push.txt[]

=== Making changes
		 Rename your Java class to "TestNewName" and create a new class
			"Test2".

		 Add the new files to Mercurial.  
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/add.txt[]
----
		
		 A rename in Java removes the old file. Mercurial will report
			these files as missing (hg status). You can use the following command
			to automatically add the new files and remove the deleted.
		
		 Add the new files to Mercurial.  
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/using/addremove.txt[]
