== Project Owner: Editing the project config through Git

It is possible to edit the project configuration file directly.
The config files are store in the projects Git repository.
They reside in the special branch `refs/meta/config`.
To check them out issue the following commands on your terminal:

[source, terminal]
----
git remote add gerrit ssh://<gerrit-site>:<gerrit-port>
git fetch gerrit refs/meta/config:gerrit-config
git checkout gerrit-config
----

Your project specific rules are in the file `project.config`.
The file follows the Git configuration format.

Assuming your project is lacking the "Verified" label you could add the following to the config:

[source, git_config]
----
[label "Verified"]
       function = MaxWithBlock
       value = -1 Fails
       value =  0 No score
       value = +1 Verified
----

Once you have done your changes you can commit and push them:

[source, terminal]
----
git commit -am "Message"
git push gerrit meta/config:meta/config
----

[[managing_project_access]]
== Project Owner: Managing project access

Project access in Gerrit is generally handled through Groups, although you can also set permissions on a per user basis.
An open source project might have a group for commiters, who can review and merge changes, and a group for their CI solutions.
To create a new group navigate to menu:People[Create New Group].

Once you have created a group you are taken to the group management page, where you can add new members to the group.

After that you can give this Group access to your project.
This is done either through the web interface at menu:Projects[Access] or by editing the projects config file as described in <<editing_project_config_git>>.
