=== Download Gerrit
		
			Download the latest Gerrit release from
			http://gerrit-releases.storage.googleapis.com/index.html">Gerrit download page</ulink>
			. The download is a
			`.war`
			file which you can directly add to your servlet container, for
			example, a Jetty or Tomcat installation.
		
		
			The
			`.war`
			file also contains a Jetty web server and can be started directly for
			testing or rapid deployment. The following
			description uses this approach.

=== Setup of Gerrit
		
			Copy the
			`.war`
			file into an empty directory.
		
		
			Switch on the command line to the location of the directory to which
			you extracted the
			`.war`
			file.
			Install and start
			Gerrit with
			the following command.
[source,console]
-----
include::res/install/install.txt[]
----
		
		
			The installation procedure allows you to configure your Gerrit
			installation. The installation is done in the folder
			specified with
			the
			`-d`
			parameter, in this example "review_site".
		
		
			The installation procedure asks a few question, pressing enter uses
			the default value which is typically fine for a
			test installation. A
			few of these options are discussed in the following table.

|Location of Git repositories
|
								Location of Git repositories, default is the
								`git`
								directory
								in the installation folder of your Gerrit installation.
							
						
						
|Database server type
|Gerrit supports several databases, by default it uses a
								preconfigured H2 database.
							
						

						
|Run as user 
|Select that Gerrits runs as "root" user.
							
						
						
|Listen on port 
|Allows you to configure the port Gerrit is listening to,
								Gerrit by default listens on
								port 29418 for SSH
								access and on
								port 8080 for web access. This can
								be changed if the ports are
								already used.
							
						
						
|Authentication method 
|
								The easiest way of
								configuring access to Gerrit is to use
								_OpenID Single Sign-on_
								which is the default setting. Use ? to see all available
								settings for this option. For testing
								"development_become_any_account" is
								a valid option, this setting allows to

		<tip>
			
				Use
				_development_become_any_account_
				to enable general access to Gerrit. This is a nice setting for
				testing. If started with this setting, you have a
				_Become_
				link in the web interface which allows you to login and to create a
				new account.
			
		

		
			After a successful installation Gerrit starts automatically. You
			can start and stop it again with the following
			commands on Linux
			based systems.
			
[source,console]
-----
include::res/install/start.txt[]
----
		
		
			On Microsoft Windows based systems you need to invoke the
			daemon directly. From a command shell switch to the folder
			<filename class="directory">gerrit_site`
			and
			run the following command to start the server.
		
		
			<programlisting language="batch">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/install/windows.txt[]
----
		
		
			This starts Gerrit.
			To stop it again, kill the running process using
			<keycombo>
				<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
				<keycap>C</keycap>
			</keycombo>
			If something goes wrong, look into the
			<filename class="directory">logs`
			folder.
		
		<tip>
			
				The local Gerrit configuration is stored in the
				<filename class="directory">./review_site/etc/`
				folder.
