== Developer: Gerrit configuration for the Git repository

After you cloned the repository from Gerrit, right-click in the
_Git Repositories_
view
on the
_origin_
remote and select
_Gerrit Configuration..._.

The default values in this dialog should be okay. Press the
finish
button.

This sets your push configuration for this remote to
_refs/for/*_
which tells Gerrit that you created or updated a change.
To
valid the
push configuration, right-click on your remote and select
_Configure push_
and ensure that the setting is similar to the
following screenshot. It
also adds a flag to your repository to tell the Eclipse Git tooling to
create a
Gerrit Change-id.

TIP: Use the _Properties_ view on your repository to see the details of your repository configuration.

The
_refs/for/*_
ensures that every push is handled by Gerrit. If you use the
_refs/heads/master_
ref mapping, you can directly push to the Git repository. This
option
is typically restricted to administrators.

TIP: You can also do this setup directly via the Git command line.
