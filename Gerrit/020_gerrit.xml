			Gerrit is a web based code review system, facilitating online
			code reviews for projects using the Git version
			control system.
			Gerrit is a Git server which adds a fine grained access control
			system
			and a
			code
			review
			system and
			workflow.
		
		
			The code review system is web based, facilitating online
			code
			reviews
			for projects using the Git version control system.
			The
			user
			interface
			of Gerrit is based on
			_Google Web Toolkit_
			and its Git
			implementation is JGit.
		

		
			A developer can use Gerrit to suggest a change. Other
			developers
			can review the change and suggest improvements.
			If a
			Gerrit change
			needs improvement, it is possible to update it
			with a new commit. Once
			the suggested
			changes are
			accepted by
			the
			reviewers,
			they
			can be merged to
			the target branch in the Git
			repository via Gerrit.
		

		
			Gerrit makes code reviews easier by showing changes in a
			side-by-side
			display. It also supports to display the
			change as a
			unified diff which is often
			easier to read on smaller screens.

		

		
			A reviewer can add comments to
			every single line
			changed.
		
		
			The main entry point for Gerrit is the
			https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit code review homepage]
			.
		
		Gerrit is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.


		

			The Gerrit review system
			uses the term
			_change_
			, to define a code review / review request. Each change is based on one commit.
		


[[gerrit_centralinfo">
=== How does Gerrit work?
		
			Gerrit can
			prevent
			users from pushing directly to the Git repository.
			If you
			push to
			Gerrit, you use a certain path (
			_ref specification_
			) which tells
			Gerrit
			that you want to create a change. This push ref
			specification is
			_refs/for/master_
			if the target of the change under review is the master branch. You
			can also push to
			_refs/for/xyz_
			to put a commit into the review queue
			for the xyz branch.
		
		
			If you push to this ref specification, Gerrit creates a new change
			or
			makes an update of an existing one.
			Gerrit uses
			the
			_Change-Id_
			information in the commit message to identify if the push is a new
			commit or an update of an existing change.
		
		
			A change consists of one or more patch sets which are used to
			improve the first proposal based on review
			comments. One patch set
			corresponds to one Git commit.
		
		
			It is still possible to bypass code review by pushing directly to
			_refs/heads/master_
			if sufficient rights have been
			granted.
		

[[gerrit_votingcategories">
=== Review categories - Verified and Code-Review
		
			Gerrit supports different categories (also known as labels) for
			review feedback. In
			its
			default configuration it
			supports the
			_Code-Review_
			category.
		
		
			In typical installations also the
			_Verified_
			category is installed.
		

		
			The
			"Verified"
			category typically means you
			were
			able to build and
			test
			the
			change
			introduced with the Gerrit change.
			Typically, this is
			done by
			an
			automated process such as a Jenkins / Hudson
			build server.
		

		The "Code-Review" category is typically used to
			vote on the
			quality of the implementation, code style,
			code
			conformity
			and that the
			overall design of
			the code is
			designed
			to
			the
			standards
			desired by the
			project.
		
		Committers and contributors can vote in these categories. 

[[gerrit_voting">
=== Voting in Gerrit
		
			The rules for voting in Gerrit is:
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					Highest vote (+2 in Code-Review and +1 in Verified) enables
						submitting
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Lowest vote (-2 in Code-Review) is a veto blocking that the
						change can be submitted and
						can't be overruled by
						other reviewers
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					You cannot submit the changes to the Git repository until
						there is the highest vote in all
						categories
					
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
		
		
			Typically Gerrit instances uses the
			_Verified_
			and the
			_Code-Review _
			category.

		
		

			If you did
			some
			manual
			testing and the code works as you
			desire then
			it is
			good to
			+1
			in the "Verified" category, or
			-1
			if it failed some of
			your
			use
			cases that must be
			resolved
			in order
			to merge. Otherwise, leave
			it as
			0
			if you did not test
			the
			code.
		
		

			Non-committers
			of the project can
			typically
			vote with -1 and +1
			in
			Code-Review to
			indicate an
			opinion in either
			way
			but
			ultimately it is up
			to the
			decision of those
			with +2 power to
			make
			the overall decision. You
			may
			want to -2 vote to
			block the
			submission
			of
			the code if it is not up to
			par with your
			project's
			standards or
			+2
			vote
			to indicate that you approve
			that the
			contribution is
			merged
			into the
			Git repository.

[[gerrit_drafts">
=== Posting draft reviews
		
			There is also a special
			_refs/drafts/master_
			refspec which you can
			use to push changes to for private review before
			publishing them to all developers.
		
		
			This is useful if
			your work is in
			progress and not ready for
			public
			review. You can also
			CC specific
			people to review this
			private change.
			Once it is ready for
			public
			review there is a
			_Publish_
			button
			to convert the draft into a
			change
			review.
