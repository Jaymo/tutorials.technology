=== The code review process
(((Code review)))
		
			During a code review process a proposed change
			is reviewed by
			other developers. Every contributor can
			suggest
			changes and update the
			suggested changes. Once the change is
			accepted
			by a committer,
			it is
			merged into the code base.
		
		
			For an efficient process it is important that the code review is
			conducted in a supportive environment where constructive feedback
			is
			given to enhance the change.
		
		
			While a code review process can be implemented without any tool
			support, it is typically more efficient if a structured code review
			system is used. Gerrit is a code review system developed for the Git
			version control system.
		
		
			It is also common practice to do an automated test build of the
			proposed merge
			using continuous integration tools like Jenkins or
			Hudson to check
			for compile time errors and to run a test suite.

=== Advantages of code review
(((Advantages of code review)))
		
			In general a structured code review process has the following
			advantages:
			<orderedlist>
				* 
					
						Early error detection:
						
							* Build problems are detected
								immediately
								by automatic test
								builds.
							
							* Logical
								flaws can be spotted by the human reviewer
								before any code
								is
								merged.
							
						
					
				
				* 
					
						Conformation to the source code standards:
						
							* 
								Allows the
								team
								to identify early in the process any
								violations with
								the team code
								standards.
							
							* 
								Helps to keep code
								readable and easier
								to
								maintain.
							
							* 
								
									In some projects the continuous integration system also
									checks for code
									standard conformity automatically as part of the
									build process.
								
							
						
					
				
				* 
					

						Knowledge exchange:
						
							* The code review process allows newcomers
								to see the code
								of other
								more experienced developers.
							
							* Developers get fast feedback on their
								suggested changes.
							
							* Experienced developers can help to evaluate the impact
								on
								the whole code.
							
						

					
				
				* 
					
						Shared code ownership: by reviewing code of other developers
						the whole team gets a solid knowledge of the complete code base.
					
				
				* 
					
						Easy entry to contribution: People
						without write
						permission to
						a repository have an easy way to start contributing and to get
						feedback.
					
				
				* 
					
						Enables review before a change is submitted: Iteration based
						on review comments / build results happen before a change is
						merged into
						the target branch. This result in a cleaner history of
						the repository.
