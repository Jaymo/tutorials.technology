== Gerrit support in Eclipse
	The Gerrit support in Eclipse is very good, that even customers which use a different IDE, use Eclipse as Gerrit
		client.
	
		To use Gerrit in Eclipse, clone the repository as seen before, and
		import
		your projects. By
		default, the Eclipse Git
		tooling creates a
		configuration that
		pushes the
		local master
		branch to the remote master
		branch. To connect with
		Gerrit,
		change
		the configuration to push the
		local master to
		`refs/for/master`
		instead.
	
	
		After cloning the repository you can configure Gerrit in the
		<guilabel>Git repositories</guilabel>
		view
		by right-clicking on the
		<wordasword>origin</wordasword>
		remote and selecting
		<guilabel>Gerrit Configuration</guilabel>
		.

		You can see the Gerrit review notes in Eclipse. Select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Open in
				Commit Viewer
			</guimenu>
		</menuchoice>
		on a commit in the History View. In the Commit Viewer you have
		an
		additional tab called
		<guilabel>Notes</guilabel>
		. Here you see the data which was created by
		the Gerrit reviewer.
