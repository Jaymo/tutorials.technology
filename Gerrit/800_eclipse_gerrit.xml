	<para>The Gerrit support in Eclipse is very good, that even customers which use a different IDE, use Eclipse as Gerrit

		To use Gerrit in Eclipse, clone the repository as seen before, and
		import
		your projects. By
		default, the Eclipse Git
		tooling creates a
		configuration that
		pushes the
		local master
		branch to the remote master
		branch. To connect with
		Gerrit,
		change
		the configuration to push the
		local master to
		<code>refs/for/master</code>
		instead.

		After cloning the repository you can configure Gerrit in the
		<guilabel>Git repositories</guilabel>
		view
		by right-clicking on the
		<wordasword>origin</wordasword>
		remote and selecting
		<guilabel>Gerrit Configuration</guilabel>
