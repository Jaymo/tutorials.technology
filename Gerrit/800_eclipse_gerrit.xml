== Gerrit support in Eclipse
	The Gerrit support in Eclipse is very good, that even customers which use a different IDE, use Eclipse as Gerrit
		client.
	
		To use Gerrit in Eclipse, clone the repository as seen before, and
		import
		your projects. By
		default, the Eclipse Git
		tooling creates a
		configuration that
		pushes the
		local master
		branch to the remote master
		branch. To connect with
		Gerrit,
		change
		the configuration to push the
		local master to
		`refs/for/master`
		instead.
	
	
		After cloning the repository you can configure Gerrit in the
		_Git repositories_
		view
		by right-clicking on the
		_origin_
		remote and selecting
		_Gerrit Configuration_
		.

		You can see the Gerrit review notes in Eclipse. Select
		menu:Open in Commit Viewer[]
		
		on a commit in the History View. In the Commit Viewer you have
		an
		additional tab called
		_Notes_
		. Here you see the data which was created by
		the Gerrit reviewer.
