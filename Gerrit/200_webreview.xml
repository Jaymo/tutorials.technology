		<para>
			If the review process has resulted review comments explaining
			how to
			improve the proposed patch, the author of the
			patch (or someone
			else)
			can adjust the
			patch. The developer
			amends the
			commit in his local
			repository and
			pushes the
			improved commit
			to Gerrit. He can
			also
			adjust
			the
			commit
			message while amending the commit.
		</para>
		<para>
			As the developer amends the commit, the same
			<wordasword>Change-Id</wordasword>
			is used and the

				Gerrit allows you to select which patch sets you want to compare in

				you may want to
				just see what the author changed between patchset 3 and patchset 5.

			After fetching a change, the developer can adjust the change and
