=== Remove a bad commit from a series of commits
		
			If you create a series
			of dependent commits, it might happen that
			one of the commits
			is rejected during the review
			process.
		

		
			In this
			case you
			cannot merge the
			other commits as they still
			have a
			dependency to the
			"bad" commit.

		During the review process commit 2 are rejected.
			The commit 3 and
			commit 4 are still good and do not depend on the changes in commit 2.

			The solution is to use interactive rebase to skip the bad
			commit.

		<tip>
			The Gerrit user interface does show "depends on" and "needed
				by" fields
				when it knows that a Gerrit review depends on another
				review. This
				helps you
				manage your dependency trail.
