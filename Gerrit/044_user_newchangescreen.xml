== Activate new change screen
	At the time of this writing you can activate a new change screen
		in your setting. In Gerrit 2.9 which was released June 2014 the new
		screen is the default. This change screen shows the Gerrit changes in
		a
		more condense form.

	By the time you read this, the "new" change screen might
		already
		be the default.
	
	Screenshots of the change screen in this $book are based on
		the
		new change screen and might be slightly different in the system you
		are using.
