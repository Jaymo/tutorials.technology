			Google uses as a data storage a facility called
			<ulink url="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">Bigtable</ulink>
			. Bigtable is a distributed, persistent, multidimensional sorted
			map. Bigtable is not a
			relational database. In Bigtable you can store
			strings under an index which consists
			out of a row key, a column key
			and a timestamp. This key points to a
			uninterpreted array of bytes
			(string) of size 64 KB.
		
		 (row key: type string, column key:type string, timestamp: type
			int64) -> string
		
			The key can get generated by the database or by the
			application.
			

		 For example in the Google Webtable (for Google search) the
			reverse URL is used as the row key, the column used for different
			attributes of the webpage and the timestamp indicates from then the
			data is. The data this key points to is some content from the
			webpage.
	

		 Bigtable is build upon the Google File System and stored in an
			immutable datastructure called SSTable. The application can define
			how
			many entries
			based on the timestamp should be keep. Alternatively
			the
			application
			can also specify how long entries should be keep.
			Bigtable
			will clean-up the obsolete data by deleting the SSTables
			which only
			contains irrelevant data using a mark-and-sweep algorithm.
