== Running Derby Server as Windows Service
	 The Derby Server is started via a batch program. In an server
		environment this batch program should be automatically started if the
		server is rebooted / started. The windows program "srvmgr" can be used
		for this purpose. For details on the tool please check the official
		documentation; the following will give a description how this can
		be
		used for Apache Derby. Install "srvmgr" and remember the installation
		path. 
	
	
		We will call our service "ApacheDerby" and the batch file is
		located
		under "C:\db-derby\bin\startNetworkServer.bat" In the command
		line register a service via: 

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/service/installservice.txt[]
----
	

	 You should receive a success message. 
	
		<tip>
			If something does wrong and you want to remove an installed service,
			you can use.
			
				<programlisting>
					<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
						parse="text" href="../examples/service/removeservice.txt" />
				</programlisting>
			
		
	

	 Run Regedt32.exe and locate the following subkey
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ApacheDerby
	
	
		From the Edit menu, select New -> Key and add a key named
		"Parameters".

	 Select the "Parameters" key, that you have just created:
		From
		the
		Edit menu, select New -> String Value. Maintain the following
		values.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/service/keys.txt[]
----
	

	 Now start/adjust the service in the Windows services control
		panel
