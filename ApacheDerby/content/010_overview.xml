			called
			Java DB.

=== Server vs. embedded mode</title>
		<para>
			Derby can be used in a
			server mode and in so-called
			<wordasword>embedded mode</wordasword>
			.
			If
			Derby runs in the server mode
			you start the Derby network
			server
			which
			will be responsible for
			handling the database requests. In
			<wordasword>embedded mode</wordasword>
			Derby runs
			within the
			JVM (Java Virtual
			Machine)
			of
			the
			application. In
			this mode
			only the application can
			access the
			database, e.g. another
			user /
			application will not be able
			to access
			the database.
