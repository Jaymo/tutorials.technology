== Settings for the PDF output

=== Title page

The title page of a pdf document can include the following attributes:

* Title
* Subtitle
* Author
* Revision

This attributes can be styled in the the file _basic-theme.yml_ in folder _themes_.

==== Title

The title is defined at the top of the .adoc file as

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document
----

==== Subtitle

If you want to define a subtitle add a `:` (a colon followed by a space) after the title

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
----

==== Author

The Author can be written just after the title with or without an attribute. 

The author can also include information as an Email or an URL inside angle brackets.
It is possible to have a list of authors. 
Multiple authors and their emails are separated by a semicolon and a space `;`. 

Without attributes:

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
Jennifer Nerlich <jn@vogella.com>
----

With attributes:
[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
:author: Jennifer Nerlich 
:email: jn@vogella.com
----

Asciidoctor uses the author’s name and email to assign values to built-in attributes that can be used throughout the document’s body. 
These attributes include: author (firstname and lastname), firstname, lastname, middlename, initials and email.

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
Jennifer Nerlich <jn@vogella.com>

My first name is {firstname}.
----

If there are multiple authors you can refere to them by using the following convention: {firstname2}, {firstname3}, etc.
 
==== Revision

The revision information is listed on the third line of the .adoc document, beneath the author information line with or without attributes.
It can include the following data:

* Revision Number: It must contain at least one numeric character. 
Letters or symbols preceding the numeric character will not be rendered. 
Unless the attribute :version-label!: is set.
* Revision Date
* Revision Remark

Revision number and revision date are separated by a `,` (comma and space). 
Revison Remark is separated by a `:` (colon and space). 

Without attributes:
 
[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
Jennifer Nerlich <jn@vogella.com>
v1.1, 15.05.2017: First draft
----

With attributes:
 
[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
:revnumber: v1.1 
:revdate: 15.05.2017
:revremark: First draft
----

=== Links

To see the links in the generated output use the following attribute in the header of you document.

[source,console]
----
:show-link-uri:
----

NOTE: Before release alpha.13 you have to use the :showlinks: attribute instead.

Also you can configure the label for a chapter via the `chapter-label` attribute, e.g. if you do not want any label you can use:

[source,console]
----
:chapter-label:
----

Unfortunately Asciidoctor does not add a page break before a  part if you use "book" as output.
See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/329.
As workaround you have to put manual line breaks into it with `<<<`.

=== Index

You can add an index to your pdf output by defining it as follows:

....
[index]
= Index
....

This will list all the defined indexes. The output will look like this:

image::index.png[]


=== Appendix

The appendix is defined as follows:

....
[appendix]
= Appendix
....



=== Styling the PDF output

In order to style the PDF output use the file _basic-theme.yml_ in folder _themes_.
In this file you can style the title page, the headings (h1, h2, h3, etc), the images and many more objects.

For example to style the heading do the following entry in the _basic-theme.yml_ file:

----
heading:
  font_style: bold
  h1:
    font_color: 999999
    font_style: italic
    align: right
----

A useful feature is to set a default width for images in the pdf output. To achieve this do the following entry:

----
image:
  width: 60%
----

=== Publishing Mode

In order to use some publishing attributes you must set the `media` attribute in the header of your AsciiDoc document as follows:

`:media: prepress`

This attribute will trigger the following settings:

* Double-sided (mirror) page margins

* Automatic facing pages

==== Double-sided (mirror) page margins

The double-sided page margins will have the following impact:
the page margins for the recto (right-hand, odd-numbered) and verso (left-hand, even-numbered) pages will be replaced by the side page margins with the values of the  page_margin_inner and page_margin_outer keys.

You can define the page_margin_inner and page_margin_outer in the theme.
This will look as follows:

[source,text]
----
page:
  margin: [0.5in, 0.67in, 0.67in, 0.67in]
  margin_inner: 0.75in
  margin_outer: 0.59in
----

These settings will trigger the following change to the output:

----
recto page margin
[0.5in, 0.59in, 0.67in, 0.75in]

verso page margin
[0.5in, 0.75in, 0.67in, 0.59in]
----

==== Automatic facing pages

Regarding to the automatic facing pages, a blank page will be inserted, if necessary, to ensure the following pages are right-hand-facing pages:

* Title page
* Table of contents
* First page of body content
* Parts and chapters 

It’s possible to disable the automatic facing feature for a given part or chapter. 
This can be done by adding the nonfacing option *[%nonfacing]* to the section node. 
When the nonfacing option is present, the part or chapter title will be placed on the following page.

----
[%nonfacing]
= Chapter Title

Chapter content
----
