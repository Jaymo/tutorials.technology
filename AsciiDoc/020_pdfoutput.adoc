== Settings for the PDF output

To see the links in the generated output use the following attribute in the header of you document.

[source,console]
----
:showlinks:
----

Also you can configure the label for a chapter via the `chapter-label` attribute, e.g. if you do not want any label you can use:

[source,console]
----
:chapter-label:
----

Unfortunately Asciidoctor does not add a page break before a  part if you use "book" as output.
See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/329.
As workaround you have to put manual line breaks into it with `<<<`.

It is possible to set a default width for images in the pdf output. To achieve this maintain in the the file `basic-theme.yml` under `themes` 
the following entry:

----
image:
  width: 60%
----
