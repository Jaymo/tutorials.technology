== Using the Eclipse IDE as Asciidoc editor

Different editors for AsciiDoc can be used within the Eclipse IDE. 
For instance the Mylyn Wiki Text plugin provides functionality to edit AsciiDoc files within the Eclipse IDE.

The `Mylyn WikiText Extras feature` can be installed from the http://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/snapshots/nightly/docs/  update site.

It provides an editor and a preview tab for Asciidoc.

One nice feature is that if you hold the CTRL (Command key on Mac), you can open files included with the `include::` directive.
This is depicted in the following screenshot.

Different outputs from the AsciiDoc file can be generated by using the `WikiText` popup menu of an AsciiDoc file.
