== Introduction into Asciidoc

=== What is Asciidoc and Asciidoctor
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. 
AsciiDoc files can be translated via the Asciidoctor toolchain to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, DocBook and man page.
Any text editor can be used. Some websites, like Github, render AsciiDoc files directly into HTML.

The following listing is an example of a simple Asciidoc file

----
include::examples/first.adoc[]
----

Asciidoc documents typically ends with the _.adoc_. 

=== Install the Asciidoctor toolchain

If you want to use Asciidoctor directly you have to install its toolchain. 
If you are using Gradle or Maven as build systems, it is not required to install Asciidoctor separately. 
Both Gradle or Maven provide plug-ins to execute Asciidoctor tasks.

[source, terminal]
----
sudo apt-get install -y asciidoctor
----

=== Importing files or file includes

You can import files via the include macro. This also works for source code includes. To use ---- in your listing use the [listing] style before that. The following example imports a file formatted as Java source code.


[listing]
....
[source,java]
----
\include::examples/source.java[]
----
....

Result:

[source,java]
----
include::examples/source.java[]
----

=== Defining lists

Lists can be defined with the * operator at the beginning of a line. You can define up to 6 levels for a list. 
Ensure to have a space before the list element. Example:
[source, terminal]
....
Docker allows to package the full stack in a container:

* OS
** Windows
** Ubuntu
* JVM,
* App server
* Application with its configuration
....

Result:
====
* OS
** Windows
** Ubuntu
* JVM,
* App server
* Application with its configuration
====


Numbered lists start with the .

....
[source, terminal]
. OS
.. Windows
.. Ubuntu
. JVM,
. App server
. Application with its configuration
....

Result:
====
. OS
.. Windows
.. Ubuntu
. JVM,
. App server
. Application with its configuration
====

=== Menus and Buttons

You can define menus and buttons with the following syntax. This requires the activation of an experimental feature, via the *:experimental:* attribute in the header section of your document.
----
menu:View[Zoom > Reset]

Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.
----

The result looks like the following.

menu:View[Zoom > Reset].

Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.

== Images and Graphics

To reference images in your AsciiDoc with the `image::` macro pointing to a relative file locatin. Use brackets to define a fixed or related size.

-----
image::img/vogellacompany.jpg[200,200]
-----

The result looks like the following:

image::img/vogellacompany.jpg[200,200]

=== Defining references

You can assign meta data to a block. Hereâ€™s an example of a quote block that includes all types of metadata:
....
.Topic Titel                                               # <1>
[[yourId]]                                                 # <2>
[yourstyle]                                                # <3>
____
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation...

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. ...
____
....

<1> title of the block
<2> reference for the block 
<3> can be used to style the corresponding block.

You can link to the references via `<<yourId>>`, for example
....
You find more information on this in <<yourId>>.
....

[[table]]
=== Table

You can create also tables in Asccidoc via the following syntax.

----
.Table Title
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3 

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===
----

The result looks like the following.

.Table Title
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3 

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===

[[test]]
=== Source code, using monospace and callouts

Use monospace text formatting to emulate how source code appears in computer terminals, 
simple text editors, and integrated development environments (IDEs). 
Enclose a string with \` for this, e.g., \`System.out.println("Hello");\` results in `System.out.println("Hello");` 


To enable syntax highlighting in the output, set the style on the block to source and specify the source language in the second attribute position. 
It is also very simple to add callouts, as demonstrated by the following snippet.

	
....
[source, java, numbered]
----
System.out.println("Hello");  # <1>
private int a;
----
<1> Imports the library
....

Output is the following

[source, java, numbered]
----
System.out.println("Hello");  # <1>
private int a;
----

<1> Imports the library

Supported types are java, xml, terminal

=== Escape special signs

If you need to escape Asciidoc commands, you can use \\{qwe} or \+++{qwe}\+++.

=== Index

You can add primary index terms to your document via +++(((yourterm)))+++. 
A secondary index can be added to your document via +++(((yourterm, secondary term2)))+++. 
For example:

+++((((Big cats)))+++

+++((((Big cats, Lions)))+++

=== Comments in Asciidoc

We can add comments to the Asciidoc markup. 
The comments are not added to the generated output. 
You can use both single and multiline comments. 
Single line comments start with a double slash (//). Multiline comments are enclosed in a block of four forward slashes (////).


=== Custom attributes / variables

You can define custom variables and use them in your document with \{youridentifier\}. For example the following defines
the variable `contentidentifier` which can be used with \{contentidentifier\} and Asciidoctor will replace 
it with the value defined after the second :.

-----
:contentidentifier: description
-----
