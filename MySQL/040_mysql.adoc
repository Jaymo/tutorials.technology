== Connecting to MySQL

MySQL provides the
`mysql`
command line interface for administrative work.


To connect to the
_MySQL_
database server use the following command.


[source,text]
----
include::res/connectMySQL.txt" />
</programlisting>


Once you have created a database on this server you can also
connect directory to the database with the following command.


[source,text]
----
include::res/connectDbMySQL.txt" />
</programlisting>

The default port of the database server is 3306, e.g., the Java
JDBC connection string to connect to the iotcloud database would be
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/iotcloud.
