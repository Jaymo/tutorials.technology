== Connecting to MySQL

MySQL provides the
<code>mysql</code>
command line interface for administrative work.


To connect to the
<wordasword>MySQL</wordasword>
database server use the following command.


<programlisting>
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
parse="text" href="./examples/connectMySQL.txt" />
</programlisting>


Once you have created a database on this server you can also
connect directory to the database with the following command.


<programlisting>
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
parse="text" href="./examples/connectDbMySQL.txt" />
</programlisting>

The default port of the database server is 3306, e.g., the Java
JDBC connection string to connect to the iotcloud database would be
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/iotcloud.
