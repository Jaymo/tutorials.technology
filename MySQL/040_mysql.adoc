== Connecting to MySQL

MySQL provides the `mysql` command line interface for administrative work.
To connect to the _MySQL_ database server use the following command:

[source,text]
----
# connect as root to MySQL server
mysql -u root -p
----

Once you have created a database on this server you can also
connect directory to the database with the following command.

[source,text]
----
mysql db_name -u user -pmypassword
----

The default port of the database server is 3306.
For example, the Java JDBC connection string to connect to the iotcloud database would be
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/iotcloud.
