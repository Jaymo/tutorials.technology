== Installation of Artifactory
	
In order to install the open source version of Artifactory you need to visit https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/[Artifactory Open Source] and download the ZIP version or the RPM version. 
Even a Docker image can be used to run Artifactory.

The ZIP version can be extracted into an arbitrary folder, e.g., the user home directory `${user-home}/artifactory`.
	
Inside the extracted folder there is a `bin` folder, which contains startup files suitable for Linux/Mac and Windows.
For Linux/Mac the `artifactory.sh` can be executed to startup a local Artifactory instance and for Windows the `artifactory.bat` can be executed.
	
	
Inside the `bin` folder are other options to run Artifactory, for examples it also can be run as a service.
