		<title>What is Artifactory?
		A Artifactory installation brings such a repository for your
			company. So you can host
			your own repositories, but also use
			Artifactory as a proxy for public repositories. With such
			a proxy the
			time to receive an artifact is reduced and it saves ï»¿bandwidth.
			Artifactory
			allows you to host your private build artifacts.
