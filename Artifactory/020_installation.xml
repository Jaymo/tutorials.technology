	<title>Installation of Artifactory
	
		In order to install the open source version of Artifactory you need to
		visit
		<ulink url="https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/">Artifactory Open Source</ulink>
		and download the ZIP
		version or the RPM version. Even a Docker image
		can be used to run Artifactory.

		The ZIP version can be extracted into an arbitrary
		folder, e.g.,
		the
		user home directory
		<filename>${user-home}/artifactory</filename>
		.
	
	
		Inside the extracted folder there is a
		<filename>bin</filename>
		folder, which contains startup files suitable for Linux/Mac and
		Windows.
		For Linux/Mac the
		<filename>artifactory.sh</filename>
		can be executed to startup a local Artifactory instance
		and for Windows
		the
		<filename>artifactory.bat</filename>
		can be executed.
	
	
		Inside the
		<filename>bin</filename>
		folder are other options to run Artifactory, for examples it also can
		be run as a service.
