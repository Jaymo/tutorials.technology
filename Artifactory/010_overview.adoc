=== What is Artifactory?

A Artifactory installation brings such a repository for your company. 
So you can host your own repositories, but also use Artifactory as a proxy for public repositories. 
With such a proxy the time to receive an artifact is reduced and it saves ï»¿bandwidth.
Artifactory allows you to host your private build artifacts.


Artifactory is available as https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial[Commercial version] and https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/[Open Source distribution].
