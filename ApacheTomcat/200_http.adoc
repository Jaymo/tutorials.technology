== Tomcat as HTTP Server

Tomcat also contains a HTTP connector which can be used to serve static HTML pages. 
The standard directory which will be served is below the _Tomcat_ `webapps/ROOT` installation directory. 
Place static content into this directory.

To allow directory browsing via Apache Tomcat change the `listings` parameter in the file `conf/web.xml` from false to true.
