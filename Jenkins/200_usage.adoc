== Setting up a Jenkins job
	
The build of a project is handled via _jobs_ in Jenkins. 
Select _New Item_ from the menu

Afterwards enter a name for the job and select _Freestyle Job_. 
Press btn:[OK].
	
The next page allows you to configure your job. 
If you for example using Git, enter the URL to the Git repository. 
If the repository is not public, you may also need to configure the credentials.

Specify when and how your build should be triggered. 
The following example polls the Git repository every 15 min.
It triggers a build, if something has changed in the repo.

I typically delete the workspace before a build to avoid any side-effect. 
In the _Build_ section you can add a build step, e.g., a Maven build.

Press btn:[Save] to finish the job definition. 
Press btn:[Build Now] on the job page to validate the job works as expected.

After a while the job should go to green or blue (depending on your configuration), if successful. 
Click on the job and afterwards on _Console Output_ to see the log file.
Here you can analyse build errors.
