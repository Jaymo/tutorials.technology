	<title>Using the Jenkins build server
	
		<wordasword>Continuous integration</wordasword>
		is a process in which all development
		work is integrated as early as possible and the resulting
		artifacts are
		automatically created and tested.
		This process should
		identify errors as very early
		in the process.
	
	
		<wordasword>Jenkins</wordasword>
		is one open source tool to perform continuous integration and build automation. The basic
		functionality of Jenkins is
		to execute a
		predefined list
		of steps.
		The trigger for this execution can be time or event based. For
		example every 20
		minutes or after a new commit in a Git repository.
	
	
		The list of steps can, for example, include:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				perform a software build with Apache
					Maven or Gradle
				
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Run a shell script
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Archive the build result
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Afterwards start the integration tests
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

	
	
		Jenkins also monitors the execution of the steps and allows to
		stop the process if one of the steps fails.
		Jenkins can also send out notifications
		about the build success or failure.
	
	
		<wordasword>Jenkins</wordasword>
		can be extended by additional plug-ins, e.g., for building and
		testing
		Android applications or to support the Git
		version control
		system.
