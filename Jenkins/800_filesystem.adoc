		<title>Jenkins backup and copying files
		
			Jenkins stores all the settings, logs and build artifacts in its home
			directory, for example, in
			<filename class="directory">/var/lib/jenkins</filename>
			under the default install location of Ubuntu.
		
		To create a backup of your Jenkins setup, just copy this
			directory.
		
		
			The
			<filename class="directory">jobs</filename>
			directory contains the individual jobs configured in the Jenkins
			install. You can move a job from one Jenkins installation to another
			by copying the corresponding job directory. You can also copy a job
			directory to clone a job or rename the directory.
		
		
			Click
			<guibutton>reload
				config
			</guibutton>
			button in the Jenkins web user interface
			to force Jenkins to reload
			configuration from the disk.

		<title>Managing Jenkins with Git
		Jenkins supports the
			https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin
			plug-in which allows you to store every change in a Git repo.
		
		It is also possible to manually maintain the Jenkins
			configuration in a Git repo.
