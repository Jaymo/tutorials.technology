=== Secure Jenkins
		
It is recommended to secure Jenkins. _Manage Jenkins_ and then _Configure Global Security_. 
Select the _Enable security_ flag. 
The easiest way is to use Jenkins own user database. 
Create at least the user "Anonymous" with read access. 
Also create entries for the users you want to add in the next step.
