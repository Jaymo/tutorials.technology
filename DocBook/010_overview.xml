=== Overview
		
			<wordasword>DocBook</wordasword>
			is a standard for creating well-formated plain text
			documents.
			DocBook
			files are written as plain text.
		
		
			For further processing
			<wordasword>DocBook</wordasword>
			files are transformed into
			other
			output
			formats. This is typically done
			via
			<wordasword>XSLT</wordasword>
			(<wordasword>
				Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation
			</wordasword>).
		
		
			<wordasword>XSLT</wordasword>
			sheets
			for converting DocBook
			into common output, e.g. HTML or PDF,
			are
