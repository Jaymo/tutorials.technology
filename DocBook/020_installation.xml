=== Eclipse
		
			Install Eclipse. See
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html[
				Eclipse IDE]
			for installing and using Eclipse.
		
		
			Eclipse has
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheAnt/article.html[
				Apache Ant]
			integrated. Therefore, no additional
			installation for Ant
			is
			required.
		


	[[installation_sheets">
=== Docbook and Stylesheets
		
			Download the Docbook DTD in version 4.5 and the latest version
			of the XSLT stylesheets.

				DocBook DTD in version 4.5]

	[[installation_xslprocessor">
=== XSL processor
		
			The download link for Saxon is:
			http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">
				http://saxon.sourceforge.net/].
		
		
			Download the version 6.5.5 as newer Saxon versions do not work
			well
			with DocBook 4.5. Saxon 9 is an XSLT 2.0 processor and the
			current
			official version of the XSL stylesheets are XSLT 1.0 based.
		
		
			Download the
			`saxon.zip`
			file. The
			`saxon.jar`
			is later needed.
		


	[[installation_issues">
=== Issues
		
			Sometimes running the XSLT conversion results in the following
			error message.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/error/error.txt[]
----
		
		
			In this case try adding the
			_xerces-j_
			XML parser to your build path
			and see if that resolves the
			error.
