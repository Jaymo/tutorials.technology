=== Overview of EPUB
		
			EPUB is a format for electronic book defined by the
			International
			Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB is based on XHTML
			and supports
			styling via CSS. An EPUB file is a ZP file with a
			predefined content.
			The ZIP file must contain a folder
			`META-INF`
			which contains a file
			`container.xml`.
			This file contains a pointer
			to
			the
			`OEBPS/content.opf`
			file. The
			`content.opf`
			contains the
			meta
			information about the book and points to the
			content pages which
			are
			defined as HTML pages.
		
		
			The Docbook XLST stylesheets support a conversion into EPUB.
			This
			conversion is based on the XHTML stylesheets and therefore
			supports the
			same parameter as in HTML. The final EPUB document
			also requries an
			additonal file mimetype with a predefined content and
			the content of
			`OEBPS`
			and
			`META-INF`.
			The XSLT transformation will not
			automatically
			create the mimetype
			file nor the ZIP file. We will use
			Apache Ant to
			create them for us.
		
		
			To validate an EPUB file, you can use the JAR file from the
			https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck">
				EPubCheck Validation Tool</ulink>.
			Download the latest 1.x version and put it into the classpath of
			your Ant file. Make sure that you also extract the
			<filename class="directory">lib`
			folder
			included in the ZIP file
			relative
			to the
			`epub*.jar`.
			After the
			conversion you can validate your
			EPUB file via
			the following
			command.
			We will include the check also in our Ant task.

=== Creating EPUB files with Apache Ant
		
			The following example is based on the same file and directory
			structure as the other examples. Create the following
			`book.xml` file
			in your <filename class="directory">input` directory.
		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/epub/book.xml[]
----
		
		
			This book refers to the
			`vogella_current_logo.png`
			image in the
			<filename class="directory">image`
			folder. Either create
			such an image or delete the part.
		
		
			Create also a folder
			<filename class="directory">epubinput`
			with a file
			`mimetype`.
			This
			file should have only the following content:
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/epub/mimetype[]
----
		
		
			The following Ant `build.xml` file will create EPUB
			output.
		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/epub/buildepub.xml[]
----
		
		
			I personally see the following issues. Please let me know if you have
			a
			solution for it.
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					
						Target location of <filename class="directory">META-INF/`
						can be specified via
						<property>epub.metainf.dir</property>,
						but if you do so this path is also used in the
						`container.xml`.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Same issue with <property>epub.oebps.dir</property>.
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
