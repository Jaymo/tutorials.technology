	=== DocBook
			
				This tutorial explains how to write DocBook files in Eclipse
				and how to convert these files into various output formats, e.g., to
				HTML and PDF. It also explains how to configure XInclude to divide
				the information into different source files.
			

			
				This tutorial uses Docbook 4.5, the Saxon XLST processor in
				version 6.5.5, Eclipse 4.3 and the XLST stylesheets in version
				1.77.1.
