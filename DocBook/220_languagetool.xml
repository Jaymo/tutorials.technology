=== What is Language Tool?
		
			https://www.languagetool.org">Language Tool</ulink>
			is an Open Source tool for checking the style and the grammar of a text. It is written in Java. Language Tool
			contains
			thousands of rules to
			detect
			grammar and style pitfalls as well
			as common typos. It is hosted at
			https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool">Github Languagetools</ulink>.
		
		
			https://github.com/vogellacompany/languagetool-eclipse-plugin">Eclipse plug-in for Language Tool</ulink>
			provides integration of this spell checker into the Eclipse IDE.
			This plug-in allows replacing the default
			spell-checker with an enhanced
			one using LanguageTool.
			The Eclipse
			integration
			is work in
			progress, but already useful as
			it filters XML
			tags and indicates
			problems in plain text
			with tooltips and red
			underlines.

			https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool">LanguageTool project</ulink>
			. Contributing new rules for undetected errors is easy and only
			requires
			editing XML files which can be developed using
			a
			web-based
			http://community.languagetool.org/ruleEditor2">Rule Editor</ulink>
			.

		
		
			The Eclipse plug-in is available on
			https://github.com/vogellacompany/languagetool-eclipse-plugin">LanguageTool Eclipse plug-in Github site</ulink>
			.
