== Tutorial: convert Docbook to HTML5
	
		The following tutorial describes how you can use Eclipse to
		convert a Docbook input file into an HTML output using Apache Ant.
	
	<section id="htmlconvert_project">
=== Project Setup
		
			In Eclipse select from the menu the
menu:File[New > Project]
			entry and select from the proposed list the
menu:General[Projects]
			entry.
		
		
			The new project is called
			_de.vogella.docbook.first_.
		
		
			Create the following folder structure:
			
				<listitem>
					input
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					input/images
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					css
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					output
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					docbook-xml-4.5
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					docbook-xsl
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					lib
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		
			Place the DocBook DTD and the XSLT stylesheets into the
			corresponding
			directories.
		
		
			Copy the
			`jar`
			files from your
			_Saxon_
			download into the
			<filename class="directory">lib`
			folder.
		


	<section id="htmlconvert_docbook">
=== Write your first DocBook document
		
			In your
			<filename class="directory">input`
			folder create a file called
			`book.xml`
			with the following content.
		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/firstdocbook/book.xml[]
----
		
		
			We also want to use images in our example.
			Place in the
			<filename class="directory">input/images`
			a graphic of type PNG called
			`title.png`.
		
		
			The
			`../docbook-xml-4.5/docbookx.dtd`
			corresponds to the
			directory you
			have created earlier in your project
			setup.
		
		
			Create the following CSS file called
			`style.css`
			in the
			<filename class="directory">css`
			folder.
		
		
			<programlisting language="css">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/firstdocbook/style.css[]
----
		


	<section id="htmlconvert_convert">
=== Use Ant to convert DocBook to HTML5
		
			Create the following
			`buildhtml.xml`
			file in your project directory.
		
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/ant/buildhtml.xml[]
----
		
			Run the `build.xml` file
			via right-click on it and by selecting
menu:Run as[Ant Build].
		
		
			Afterwards, check the output directory. You should find
			an
			<filename class="directory">Example`
			directory, with the
			`book.html`
			file.
		
		
			Congratulations, you created your first DocBook and converted it
			into an HTLM document.
