		You can now also use Eclipse to automatically create your
		DocBook output.
	
	
		On your project right-click with the mouse. Select <guibutton>Properties</guibutton>.
		Go to <guibutton>Builder</guibutton> and press <guibutton>New</guibutton>.
		Select <guilabel>Ant build</guilabel> and select your existing
		ant `build.xml` file.
	
	
		Under targets select <guilabel>Select-targets</guilabel>
		in the <guilabel>Auto-Build</guilabel> section
		and select your target.
	
	
		On the tab <guibutton>Build Options</guibutton> you can specify
		a working set for relevant resources.
		This would be your source folder.
	
	
		Now Eclipse will create your new output always after saving.
