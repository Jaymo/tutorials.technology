== Convert Docbook to plain text
	
		The best way to convert Docbook files to plain text is first to
		convert them to HTML and then use the text browser Lynx to convert it
		to text with the following command.
	
	
		<programlisting language="bourne">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/text/plaintext.sh[]

	This way the text is well structured, e.g., tables are looking nice.
