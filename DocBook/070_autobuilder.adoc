== Eclipse Autobuilder

You can now also use Eclipse to automatically create your
DocBook output.

On your project right-click with the mouse. Select btn:[Properties].
Go to btn:[Builder] and press btn:[New].
Select _Ant build_ and select your existing
ant `build.xml` file.

Under targets select _Select-targets_
in the _Auto-Build_ section
and select your target.

On the tab btn:[Build Options] you can specify
a working set for relevant resources.
This would be your source folder.

Now Eclipse will create your new output always after saving.
