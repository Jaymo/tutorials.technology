[[languagetool_about]]
=== What is Language Tool?

https://www.languagetool.org[Language Tool]
is an Open Source tool for checking the style and the grammar of a text. It is written in Java. Language Tool
contains
thousands of rules to
detect
grammar and style pitfalls as well
as common typos. It is hosted at
https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool[Github Languagetools].

https://github.com/vogellacompany/languagetool-eclipse-plugin[Eclipse plug-in for Language Tool]
provides integration of this spell checker into the Eclipse IDE.
This plug-in allows replacing the default
spell-checker with an enhanced
one using LanguageTool.
The Eclipse
integration
is work in
progress, but already useful as
it filters XML
tags and indicates
problems in plain text
with tooltips and red
underlines.
