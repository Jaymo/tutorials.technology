== The required toolset

To create _DocBook_ files and to convert them into other formats, you need the following tools.

* The DocBook DTD which defines the structure of a _DocBook_ document.
* An XSLT stylesheet to convert your _DocBook_ file into another format.
* An XSLT parser

In this tutorial you use the
Eclipse IDE
as an XML editor,
Saxon
as
the
XSLT
parser and
Apache Ant
for the XSLT
transformation.
