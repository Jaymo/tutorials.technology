			`XInclude` can be used to structure the DocBook source files so
			that you have one file per chapter / section and one master file
			which includes these files. Via `XInclude` these
			separate files
			can be
			combined into one file.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can, for example, include a file `foo.xml`
			into another one via the
			following statement
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/xincludeexample1.xml" />
			</programlisting>
			In case this file should be treated as text:
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/xincludeexample2.xml" />
			</programlisting>
