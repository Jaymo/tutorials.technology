== Using XInclude with Eclipse XSL
	<section id="xinclude_overview">
=== Overview
		
			`XInclude` can be used to structure the DocBook source files so
			that you have one file per chapter / section and one master file
			which includes these files. Via `XInclude` these
			separate files
			can be
			combined into one file.
		
		
			You can, for example, include a file `foo.xml`
			into another one via the
			following statement
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/xincludeexample1.xml" />
			</programlisting>
			In case this file should be treated as text:
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/xincludeexample2.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Am XInclude ant task is provided by the Eclipse XSL project. I
			can proudly say that this ant task was contributed by me to the
			Eclipse XLS project. :-)

=== Eclipse XSL Tools
		
			Eclipse XSL Tools provide support for XSLT transformations. It
			supports XSL editing and debugging support. We will only use the
			XInclude task, but you have to install the whole package.
	
		
			Install the XSL tools via the update manager from the standard
			Eclipse update site. See
			<ulink
				url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html#updatemanager">
				Using the Eclipse update manager</ulink>
			for details.

=== Using the XInclude ant task
		
			From your Eclipse installation take the
			`org.eclipse.wst.xsl.core.jar` and add this JAR file to your ant
			classpath. Put the new JAR into your Ant classpath. See
			<ulink
				url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheAnt/article.html#classpath">
				Apache Ant Tutorial - Classpath</ulink>
			for details.
		
		
			You should now be able to create and run the xinclude task.
			Below an example ant build.xml file.
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/ant/buildxinclude.xml" />
			</programlisting>
