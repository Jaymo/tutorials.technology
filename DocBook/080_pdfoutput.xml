=== Overview
		
			You can convert DocBook to XML-FO via the DocBook XSL
			Stylesheets. XML FO stands for XML Formating Objects and is an XML
			standard
			which is optimized for print media. XML-FO can then be
			tranlated into PDF via the Apache FOP library.

=== Installation
		
			In addition to the existing setup you also require the Apache
			FOP
			library. Download the binary FOP distribution from
			<ulink
				url="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">
				http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/</ulink>.
		
		
			Copy all the JAR files from the FOP distribution in your library
			directory
			and add the libs to the ant build path. See
			<ulink
				url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheAnt/article.html#classpath">
				Apache Ant Tutorial</ulink>
			on how to modify the ant build path.

			You have to add the task to your ant build file and then call
			the task. The following snippet shows how to define the task and how to call
			it. The second listing is then a full example ant `build.xml` file.
