== What is a patch file?
(((Patch)))

A _patch_ is a text file that contains changes to other text files in a standarized format.
A patch created with the `git format-patch` command includes meta-information about the commit
(committer, date, commit message, etc) and also contains the changes introduced in binary data in the commit.

This file can be sent to someone else and the receiver can use it to apply the changes to his local repository. 
The metadata is preserved.

Alternatively you could create a diff file with the `git diff` command, but this diff file does not contain the metadata information.
