= What is a patch file?

(((Patch)))
 A _patch_ is a text file that
contains changes to the source code. A patch created with the
`git format-patch` command includes meta-information about the commit
(committer, date, commit message, etc) and also contains the changes
introduced in binary data in the commit, for example, an image.

This file can be sent to someone else and this developer can use this
file to apply the changes to his local repository. The metadata is
preserved.

Alternatively you could create a diff file with the `git diff` command,
but this diff file does not contain the metadata information.
