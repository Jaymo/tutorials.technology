= Example: Using cherry-pick

In the following example you create a new branch and commit two changes.

[source,terminal]
----
include::./examples/cherry/step1.txt[]
----

You can check the commit history, for example, with the `git log --oneline` command.

[source,terminal]
----
include::./examples/cherry/step2.txt[]
----

The following command selects the first commit based on the commit ID and applies its changes to the master branch. 
This creates a new commit on the master branch.

[source,terminal]
----
include::./examples/cherry/step3.txt[]
----

The `cherry-pick` command can be used to change the order of commits. 
`git cherry-pick` also accepts commit ranges for example in the following command.

[source,terminal]

include::./examples/cherry/step4.txt[]
