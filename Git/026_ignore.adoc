== Ignoring files and directories with a .gitignore file

(((Ignore files)))

((.gitignore))

Git can be configured to ignore certain files and directories for repository operations. This is
configured via one or several `.gitignore` files. Typically, this file
is located at the root of your Git repository but it can also be located
in sub-directories. In the second case the defined rules are only valid
for the sub-directory and below.

You can use certain wildcards in this file. `*` matches several
characters. More patterns are possible and described under the following
URL: https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html[gitignore
manpage]

For example, the following `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the
`bin` and `target` directories and all files ending with a ~.

[source,terminal]
----
include::./examples/ignore/gitignore[]
----

You can create the `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the working
tree to make it specific for the Git repository.


[TIP]
====
The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the specified files in Git
commands. You can still add ignored files to the _staging area_ of the
Git repository by using the `--force` parameter, i.e. with the
`git add --force [paths]` command.

This is useful if you want to add, for example, auto-generated binaries,
but you need to have a fine control about the version which is added and
want to exclude them from the normal workflow.
====

It is good practice to commit the local `.gitignore` file into the Git
repository so that everyone who clones this repository have it.

[[global-cross-repository-.gitignore-settings]]

== Global (cross-repository) .gitignore settings

You can also setup a global `.gitignore` file valid for all Git
repositories via the `core.excludesfile` setting. The setup of this
setting is demonstrated in the following code snippet.

[source,terminal]
----
include::./examples/gitignore/global.txt[] 
----

The global `.gitignore` file is only locally available.

[[local-per-repository-ignore-rules]]

== Local per-repository ignore rules

You can also create local per-repository rules by editing the
`.git/info/exclude` file in your repository. These rules are not
committed with the repository so they are not shared with others.

This allows you to exclude, for example, locally generated files.
