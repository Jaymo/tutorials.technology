			An
			_alias_
			in Git allows you to create a short form of one or several existing Git commands. For
			example, you can
			define an alias which is a short form of your own
			favorite commands or
			you can
			combine
			several commands with an alias.

			The following defines an
			_alias_
			to see the staged changes with the new
			`git staged`
			command.

			Or you can define an
			_alias_
			for a detailed
			`git log`
			command.
			The following command defines the
			`git ll
			`
			_alias_
			.

			You can also run external commands. In this case you start the
			_alias_
			definition with a
			`!`
			character. For example, the following defines the
			`git ac`
			command which combines
			`git add . -A`
			and
			`git commit`
			commands.

				In the past _msysGit_
				for Windows had problems with
				an
				_alias_
				beginning with
				`!`,
				but it has been reported that this now works with
				_msysGit_, too
				.
