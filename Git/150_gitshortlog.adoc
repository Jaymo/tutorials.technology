=== git shortlog for release announcements

((git shortlog))
The `git shortlog` command summarizes the `git log` output. 
It groups all commits by author and includes the first line of the commit message.

The `-s` option suppresses the commit message and provides a commit
count. The `-n` option sorts the output based on the number of commits
by author.
