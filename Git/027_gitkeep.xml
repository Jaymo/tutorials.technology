		<para>
			If you want to track an empty directory in your Git repository, it is
			a good practice
			to put a
			file
			called
			<filename>.gitignore</filename>
			in
			the directory. As the directory now contains a
			file,
			Git includes it
			into
			its version control mechanism.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				The
				file
				could be called
				anything. Others sources recommend to call the
				file
				<filename>.gitkeep</filename>
				. One problem with this approach is that
				<filename>.gitkeep</filename>
				is unlikely to
				be ignored by build systems,
				resulting in the
				<filename>.gitkeep</filename>
				file
				being copied to the output repository.
