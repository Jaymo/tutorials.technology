== Differences between branches

(((difference between branches)))
(((git diff, for branches)))
To see the difference between two branches you can use the following command.

[source,terminal]
----
# shows the differences between
# current head of master and your_branch

git diff master your_branch
----

You can use commit ranges as described in <<commitreference_ranges_doubledot>> and <<commitreference_ranges_tripledot>>. 
For example, if you compare a branch called _your_branch_ with the _master_ branch the
following command shows the changes in _your_branch_ and _master_ since
these branches diverged.
