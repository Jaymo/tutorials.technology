[source,terminal]

You can also use commit ranges as described in <<commitreference_ranges_doubledot>> and <<commitreference_ranges_tripledot>>. 
For example, if you compare a branch called _your_branch_ with the _master_ branch the
following command shows the changes in _your_branch_ and _master_ since
these branches diverged.
