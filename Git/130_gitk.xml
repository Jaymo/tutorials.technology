== Commit history of a repository or certain files
	
		http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk">Gitk</ulink> can be used to visualize the history of a repository of certain files.
	 In some cases simply using `git blame` is not sufficient in order to see all
		details of certain changes. Therefore you can for exmaple navigate to the filelocation in
		the target git repository and use the `gitk [filename]` command to see all
		commits of a file in a clear UI.
    In this screenshot we can see all commits of the
		_ShowViewHandler.java_ by using the `gitk ShowViewHandler.java` command:

	On linux you can easily install gitk by using the `sudo apt-get install gitk` command in a terminal.
	See http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk">http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk</ulink> for
		further information.
