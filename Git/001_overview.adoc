== What is a version control system?

(((Version control system)))

A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the history of a collection of
files. It supports creating different versions of this collection. Each
version captures a snapshot of the files at a certain point in time and
the VCS allows you to switch between these versions. These versions are
stored in a specific place, typically called a _repository_.

You may, for example, revert the collection of files to a state from 2
days ago. Or you may switch between versions of your files for
experimental features.

The process of creating different versions (snapshots) in the repository
is depicted in the following graphic. Please note that this picture fits
primarily to Git. Other version control systems like _Concurrent
Versions System_ (CVS) don't create snapshots but store file deltas.

VCS are
typically used to track changes in _source code_ for a programmingit Tutorial
language or other text files, like HTML code or configuration files. But
a typical version control system can put any type of file under version
control, e.g., you may use a VCS to track the different versions of your
company logo.

== Localized and centralized version control systems

A localized version control system keeps local copies of the files. This
approach can be as simple as creating a manual copy of the relevant
files. A centralized version control system provides a server software
component which stores and manages the different versions of the files
and let developer copy (checkout) a certain version onto their
individual computer.

Both approaches have the drawback that they have only one single point
of failure, e.g., in localized version control systems the individual
computer and in a centralized version control systems the server
machine. Both system makes it also harder to work in parallel on
different features.

== What is a distributed version control system?

(((Version control system, distributed version control system)))

In a
distributed version control system each user has a complete local copy
of a repository on his individual computer. The user can copy an
existing repository. This copying process is typically called _cloning_
and the resulting repository can be referred to as a _clone_ .

Every clone contains the full history of the collection of files and a
cloned repository has the same functionality as the original repository.

Every repository can exchange versions of the files with other
repositories by transporting these changes. This is typically done via a
repository running on a server which is, unlike the local machine of a
developer, always online. Typically there is a central server for
keeping a repository but each cloned repository is a full copy of this
repository. The decision which of the copies is considered to be the
central server repository is pure convention and not tied to the
capabilities of the distributed version control system itself.

## What is Git?

(((What is Git)))

_Git_ is currently the most popular
implementation of a distributed version control system.

Git originates from the Linux kernel development and was founded in 2005
by Linus Torvalds. Nowadays it is used by many popular open source
projects, e.g., the Android or the Eclipse developer teams, as well as
many commercial organizations.

The core of Git was originally written in the programming language _C_ ,
but Git has also been re-implemented in other languages, e.g., Java,
Ruby and Python.
