== What are branches?

((Branches in Git))

Git allows you to create _branches_, i.e. named pointers to commits. 
You can work on different branches independently from each other. 
The default branch is most often called _master_.

A branch pointer in Git is 41 bytes large, 40 bytes of characters and an additional new line character. 
Therefore, the creating of branches in Git is very fast and cheap in terms of resource consumption. 
Git encourages the usage of branches on a regular basis.

If you decide to work on a branch, you _checkout_ this branch. 
This means that Git populates the _working tree_ with the version of the
files from the commit to which the branch points and moves the _HEAD_
pointer to the new branch.

As explained in <<gitterminology>> _HEAD_ is a symbolic reference usually pointing to the
branch which is currently checked out.
