			The
			<code>git status</code>
			command shows the working tree status, i.e. which files have changed,
			which are staged and which
			are not part of the staging area. It also
			shows
			which files have conflicts and gives an indication what
			the
			user
			can
			do with these changes, e.g., add them to the staging area
			or remove
			them,
			etc.

			Before committing changes to a Git repository you need to mark

			the staging area. This creates a

			files.

			In case you change one of the staged

		<para>
			After adding the files to the Git staging area, you can commit them
			to
			the
			Git repository. This creates a new commit object with the staged
			changes in the Git
			repository and the HEAD reference points to the new
			commit. The
			<parameter>-m</parameter>
			parameter
			allows you to specify the commit message.
			If you leave this
			parameter
			out, your default editor is started and you
			can enter the
			message in
			the editor.
