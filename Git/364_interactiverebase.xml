	<para>
		This command opens your editor of choice and lets you configure the
		rebase
		operation by defining which commits to
		<wordasword>pick</wordasword>
		,
		<wordasword>squash</wordasword>
		or
		<wordasword>fixup</wordasword>
		.
	</para>
	<para>
		The following listing shows an example of
		the
		selection, we pick
		the last
		commit, squash 5 commits and fix the
		sixth
		commit. The listing uses the
		long format of the commands (for example
		<parameter>fixup</parameter>
		instead of the short form
		<parameter>f</parameter>
		) for better readability.
