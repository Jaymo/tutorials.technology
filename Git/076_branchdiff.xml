		You can also use commit ranges as described in
		<xref linkend="commitreference_ranges_doubledot" />
		and
		<xref linkend="commitreference_ranges_tripledot" />
		.
		For example, if you
		compare a branch called
		<wordasword>your_branch</wordasword>
		with the
		<wordasword>master</wordasword>
		branch the following command shows the changes in
		<wordasword>your_branch</wordasword>
		and
		<wordasword>master</wordasword>
		since these branches diverged.
