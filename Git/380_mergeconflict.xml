			<primary>Merge conflict</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>A conflict during a merge operation
			occurs
			if two commits from
			different
			branches
			have modified the same
			content
			and Git cannot
			automatically
			determine
			how both changes
			should be
			combined when merging
			these branches.
		</para>
		<para>This happens for example if the same line in a file has been
			replaced by
			two different commits.
		</para>
		<para> If a conflict occurs, Git marks the conflict in the
			file
			and the
			programmer has to resolve the conflict manually.
		</para>
		<para>After
			resolving it, he adds the file to the staging area and
			commits the
			change. These steps are required to finish the merge
			operation.

		<para>
			Sometimes if a conflict occurs the developer does not want to
			solve
			the
			conflict. He decides that he wants to keep the
			original
			version or
			the new
			version of the file.
		</para>
		<para>
			For this, there is the
			<parameter>--theirs</parameter>
			and the
			<parameter>--ours</parameter>
			options on the
			<code>git checkout</code>
			command. The first option keeps the version
			of the file
			that you merged
			in, and the second option keeps the version before the merge
			operation was started.
