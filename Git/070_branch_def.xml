	<para>
		Git allows you to create
		<wordasword>branches</wordasword>
		, i.e. named pointers to commits.
		You can work on different branches
		independently from each other. The default branch is most often called
		<wordasword>master</wordasword>
		.
	</para>
	<para>
		A branch pointer in Git is 41 bytes large, 40 bytes of characters
		and an additional new line character.
		Therefore, the creating of
		branches in Git is very
		fast and cheap in terms
		of
		resource
		consumption.
		Git
		encourages the usage of branches on a regular
		basis.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you decide to work on a branch, you
		<wordasword>checkout</wordasword>
		this branch. This means that Git
		populates the
		<wordasword>working tree</wordasword>
		with the version of the files from the commit to which the branch
		points
		and
		moves the
		<wordasword>HEAD</wordasword>
		pointer to the new branch.
	</para>
	<para>
		As explained in
		<xref linkend="gitterminology" />
		<wordasword>HEAD</wordasword>
		is a symbolic reference
		usually pointing to the branch which is currently checked
		out.
