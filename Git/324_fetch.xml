			The
			`git fetch`
			command updates your
			remote-tracking branches, i.e., it updates the
			local copy of branches stored in a remote
			repository. The following
			command updates the
			remote-tracking branches
			from the repository
			called
			_origin_
			.
		

		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/fetch/fetch.txt[]
----


		
			The fetch
			command
			only
			updates the
			_remote-tracking branches_
			and none of the local
			branches
			and it does not change the working tree
			of the Git repository.
			Therefore, you can run the
			`git fetch`
			command
			at any
			point in
			time.
		
		
			After reviewing
			the changes in
			the
			remote
			tracking
			branch you can
			merge the
			changes into your local branches or
			rebase your local
			branches onto
			the remote-tracking branch.
		
		
			Alternatively you
			can also
			use the
			`git cherry-pick commit_id`
			command
			to take
			over
			only
			selected commits.
		
		
			See
			<<cherrypick_definition" />
			for information about cherry-pick. See
			<<gitmerge_definition" />
			for the merge operation and
			<<rebase_branches" />
			for the rebase command.

=== Fetch from all remote repositories
		
			The
			`git fetch`
			command updates only the
			remote-tracking branches
			for one remote
			repository. In case you want to update the
			remote-tracking branches
			of
			all your remote repositories you can use the following command.

=== Compare remote-tracking branch with local branch
		The following code shows a few options how you can compare your
			branches.
		
		[source,console]

			The above commands show the changes introduced in HEAD compared
			to
			origin. If you want to see the changes in origin compared to HEAD,
			you
			can switch the arguments or use the
			`-R`
			parameter.

=== Rebase your local branch onto the remote-tracking branch
		
		
			LARSPRIMARYINDEX"Rebase based on a remote-tracking branch"LARSPRIMARYINDEX
		

		
			You can rebase your current local branch onto a
			remote-tracking
			branch. The
			following commands demonstrate that.

=== Fetch compared with pull
		
			LARSPRIMARYINDEX"Fetch compared with pull"LARSPRIMARYINDEX
		
		
			The
			`git pull`
			command performs a
			`git fetch`
			and
			`git merge`
			(or
			`git rebase`
			based on your Git settings). The
			`git fetch`
			does not perform any operations on your local branches. You can
			always
			run the fetch command and review the incoming changes.
