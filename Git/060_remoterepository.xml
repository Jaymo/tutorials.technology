		<para>
			Git supports several transport
			protocols to connect to other Git
			repositories; the native protocol for Git is also called
			<code>git</code>
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			The following command clones an existing repository using the
			Git protocol. The Git protocol uses the port 9148 which might be
			blocked by firewalls.

			If you have SSH access to a Git repository, you can also use the
			<code>ssh</code>
			protocol. The name preceding @ is the user name used for the SSH
			connection.

			Alternatively you could clone the same repository via the

		<title>Add more remote repositories</title>
		<para>
			As discussed earlier cloning repository creates a
			<wordasword>remote</wordasword>
			called
			<code>origin</code>
			pointing to the remote repository which you cloned from.
			You can push
			changes to this
			repository via
			<code>git push</code>
			as Git uses
			<parameter>origin</parameter>
			as default.
			Of course, pushing to a remote repository requires write
			access to
			this
			repository.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can add more
			<wordasword>remotes</wordasword>
			via
			the
			<code>git
				remote
				add [name] [URL_to_Git_repo]
			</code>
			command. For example, if you cloned the
			repository from
			above
			via the
			Git
			protocol, you could add a new remote with the name
			<wordasword>github_http</wordasword>
			for the http
			protocol via the following command.

			To rename an existing remote repository use the
			<code>git remote rename</code>

		<para>
			It is possible to use the HTTP protocol to clone Git
			repositories. This
			is especially helpful if your firewall blocks
			everything except HTTP or HTTPS.

		<title>Using a proxy</title>
		<para>
			Git also provides support for HTTP access via a proxy server.
			The
			following Git
			command could, for example, clone a repository
			via
			HTTP and
			a proxy.
			You can
			either set the proxy variable in general for
			all
			applications
			or set
			it only for Git.

		<para>The following listing configures the proxy via environment variables.
