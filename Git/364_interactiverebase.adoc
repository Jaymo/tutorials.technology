== Example: Interactive rebase

The following commands create several commits which will be used for the
interactive rebase.

[source,console]
----
include::./res/rebase/git_rebase_commits[]
---- 

We want to combine the last seven commits. You can do this interactively via the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::./res/rebase/rebase_i.txt[]
----

This command opens your editor of choice and lets you configure the rebase operation by defining which commits to _pick_, _squash_ or _fixup_ .

The following listing shows an example of the selection. 
We pick the last commit, squash 5 commits and fix the sixth commit. 
The listing uses the long format of the commands (for example `fixup` instead of the short form `f` ) for better readability.

[source,console]
