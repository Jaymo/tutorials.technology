	<para>
		The
		<code>git cherry-pick</code>
		command allows you to select the patch which was introduced with an
		individual commit and apply this patch on another branch. The patch
		is
		captured as a new commit on the other branch.
	</para>
	<para>
		This way you can select individual changes from one branch and
		transfer them to another branch.

		<para>
			The new commit does not point back to its original commit so
			do
			not use
			cherry-pick blindly since you may end up with several
			copies
			of
			the
			same change. Most often cherry-pick is either used
			locally (to
			emulate an interactive rebase) or to port individual bug fixes done
			on a
			development branch
			into
			maintenance branches.
