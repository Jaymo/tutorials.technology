[[cherrypick_definition]]
= Applying a single commit

((git cherry-pick))
 The `git cherry-pick`
command allows you to select the patch which was introduced with an
individual commit and apply this patch on another branch. The patch is
captured as a new commit on the other branch.

This way you can select individual changes from one branch and transfer
them to another branch.

[NOTE]
====
The new commit does not point back to its original commit so do not use
cherry-pick blindly since you may end up with several copies of the same
change. Most often cherry-pick is either used locally (to emulate an
interactive rebase) or to port individual bug fixes done on a
development branch into maintenance branches.
