		<para>Every time a developer presses return on the keyboard an
			invisible character called a line ending is inserted. Unfortunately,
			different
			operating systems handle line endings differently.
		</para>
		<para>Linux and Mac use different line endings than Windows. Windows
			uses a carriage-return and a linefeed character (CRLF), while Linux
			and Mac
			only uses a linefeed character (LF). This becomes a problem if
			developers use different operating system to commit changes to a Git
			repository.
		</para>
		<para>To avoid commits because of line ending differences in your Git
			repository you should configure all clients to write the same line
			ending to the Git repository.

		<para>On Windows systems you can tell Git to convert line endings

		<para>
			You can also configure the line ending handling per repository
			by
			adding a special
			<filename>.gitattributes</filename>
			file to the root folder of your Git repository. If this file is
			committed to the repository, it overrides the
			<code>core.autocrlf</code>
			setting of the individual developer.
		</para>
		<para>In this file you can configure Git to auto detect the line
			endings.

		<note>
			<para>
				Not all graphical Git tools support the
				<filename>.gitattributes</filename>
				file, for example the Eclipse IDE does currently not support it. See
