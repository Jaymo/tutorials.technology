[[ignorekeep_gitkeep]]
= Git and empty directories

[[ignorekeep_gitkeep1]]
== Default behaviour of Git for empty directories

((Empty directory handling in Git))
 Git
ignores empty directories, i.e., it does not put them under version
control.

[[ignorekeep_gitkeep2]]
== Tracking empty directories

((Tracking an empty directory in Git))
 If
you want to track an empty directory in your Git repository, it is a
good practice to put a file called `.gitignore` in the directory. As the
directory now contains a file, Git includes it into its version control
mechanism.

[NOTE]
====
The file could be called anything. Others sources recommend to call the
file `.gitkeep` . One problem with this approach is that `.gitkeep` is
unlikely to be ignored by build systems, resulting in the `.gitkeep`
file being copied to the output repository.
