		A
		<wordasword>patch</wordasword>
		is a text file that contains changes to the source code. A patch
		created with the
		<code>git format-patch</code>
		command includes meta-information
		about the commit (committer, date,
		commit message, etc) and also
		contains the changes introduced in binary data in
		the commit, for example, an image.
	</para>
	<para>
		This file
		can
		be sent to someone else and
		this developer can use
		this
		file
		to
		apply
		the
		changes to his local
		repository. The metadata is
		preserved.
	</para>
	<para>
		Alternatively you could create a diff file with the
		<code>git diff</code>
		command, but this diff file does not contain the metadata information.
