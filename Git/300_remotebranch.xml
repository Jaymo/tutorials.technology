			Your local Git repository contains references to the state of
			the
			branches on
			the remote repositories to which it is connected. These
			local references are called
			_remote-tracking branches_
			.
		
		
			You can see your
			remote-tracking branches
			with the following command.
		
		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/showremotes.txt[]
----

		
			To update remote-tracking branches without changing local branches
			you
			use the
			`git fetch`
			command which is covered in
			<xref linkend="gitfetch" />
			.

		It is also safe to delete a remote branch in your local Git
			repository. You can use the following command for that.
		

		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/delete.txt[]

			The next time you run the
			`git fetch`
			command the remote branch is recreated.

		To delete the branch in a remote repository use the following
			command.
		

		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/deleteremotebranch2.txt[]
----
		Alternatively you can also use the following command. 
		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/deleteremotebranch.txt[]
----
		
			For example if you want to delete the branch called
			_testbranch_
			in the remote repository called
			_origin_
			you can use the following command.

		

		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/deleteremotebranch3.txt[]
----

		<note>
			Note you can also specify the remote repository's URL. So the
				following command also works.

=== Tracking branches
		
			LARSPRIMARYINDEX"Tracking branch"LARSPRIMARYINDEX
		
		
			_Branches_
			can track another branch. This is called
			_to have an upstream branch_
			and such branches can be referred to as
			_tracking branches_
			.
		

		
			_Tracking branches_
			allow you to use the
			`git pull`
			and
			`git push`
			command directly without specifying the branch and repository.
		


		
			If you clone a Git repository, your local
			_master_
			branch
			is created as a
			_tracking branch_
			for the
			_master_
			branch of the
			_origin_
			repository (short:
			_origin/master_
			)
			by Git.

=== Setting up tracking branches
		
			You create new
			_tracking branches_
			by specifying the
			_remote branch_
			during the creation of a branch. The following example demonstrates
			that.
		
		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/trackingbranch.txt[]
----


		
			Instead of using the
			`git checkout`
			command you can also use the
			`git branch`
			command.
		
		[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remotebranch/create.txt[]
----

		
			The
			`--no-track`
			allows you to specify that you do not want to track a branch.
			You can explicitly add a tracking branch with the
			`git branch -u`
			command later.

=== See the branch information for a remote repository
		To see the tracking branches for a remote repository (short:
			remote) you can use the
			following command.
		
		[source,console]

include::./examples/remotebranch/showtrackingbranches.txt[]

		An example output of this might look as follows.
