		<title>The git merge command</title>
		<para>
			The
			<code>git merge</code>
			command
			performs a merge.
			You can merge changes
			from
			one
			branch to the
			current
			active one
			via
			the
			following command.

		<title>Specifying merge strategies</title>
		<para>
			The
			<parameter>-s</parameter>
			parameter allows you to specify other merge strategies.
			This
			is
			demonstrated with the following command.
		</para>
		<para>
			For example,
			you can specify the
			<wordasword>ours</wordasword>
			strategy in which the result of the merge is always that of the
			current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other
			branches. This is demonstrated with the following command.

			<para>
				Be careful if you use the
				<wordasword>ours</wordasword>
				merge strategy, it ignores
				everything from the branch which is
				merged.
			</para>
		</warning>
		<para>The usage of the octopus merge strategy is triggered if you
			specify more than one reference to merge.

	<section id="gitmerge_mergeoptions">
		<title>Specifying parameters for the default merge strategy</title>
		<para>
			The recursive merge strategy (default) allows you to specify
			flags
			with the
			<parameter>-X</parameter>
			parameter. For example you can specify here the
			<parameter>ours</parameter>
			option. This option forces conflicting changes to be auto-resolved
			by favoring the local version. Changes from the other branch
			that do
			not conflict with our local version are reflected to the
			merge
			result. For a
			binary file, the entire contents are taken from
			the
			local
			version.
		</para>
		<warning>
			<para>
				The
				<parameter>ours</parameter>
				option for the
				<wordasword>recursive</wordasword>
				merge strategy should not be confused with
				the
				<wordasword>ours</wordasword>
				merge strategy.
			</para>
		</warning>

		<para>
			A
			similar option to
			<parameter>ours</parameter>
			is the
			<parameter>theirs</parameter>
			option. This option prefers the version from the branch which is
			merged.
		</para>
		<para>Both options are demonstrated in the following example code.
		</para>
		[source,terminal]

		<para>
			Another useful option is the
			<parameter>ignore-space-change</parameter>
			parameter which ignores whitespace changes.
		</para>

		<title>Enforcing the creation of a merge commit</title>
		<para>
			If you prefer to have merge commits even for situations in which Git
			could perform a fast-forward
			merge you can use the
			<code>git merge --no-ff</code>
			command.
		</para>
		<para>
			The
			<parameter>--no-ff</parameter>
			parameter can make sense if you want to record in the history at
			which time you merged from a maintenance branch to the master branch.
		</para>
		<para>
			When pulling from a
			remote
			repository, prefer doing a rebase to a
			merge. This will help to
			keep the history easier to read. A merge commit can be helpful to
			document that functionality was developed in parallel.
