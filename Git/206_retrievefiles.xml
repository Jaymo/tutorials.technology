		<para>
			The
			<code>git show</code>
			command allows to see and retrieve files from branches, commits and
			tags.
			It allows seeing the status of these files in the selected
			branch, commit or tag without
			checking them out into your working
			tree.
		</para>
		<para>
			By default, this command addresses a file from the root of the
			repository, not the current
			directory. If you want the current
			directory then
			you have to use the ./ specifier. For example to
			address the
			<filename>pom.xml</filename>
			file the current directory use:
			<filename>./pom.xml</filename>

		</para>
		<para>The following commands demonstrate that. You can
			also make a copy
			of the file.
