			If you have untracked files in your working tree which you want to
			remove, you can use the
			`git clean`
			command.
		
		<warning>
			Be careful with this command. All untracked files are
				removed if you run this command. You will not
				be
				able to restore them, as
				they are not part of
				your Git
				repository.
