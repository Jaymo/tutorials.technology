== Exercise: Setup the Gradle Daemon

=== Target

In this exercise the Gradle Daemon will be configured, so that it starts automatically when a build is run.

=== Configuring the Gradle Daemon

When using the Gradle command the first time a _.gradle_ folder is created in the ${USER_HOME} directory.

On Linux this is usually /home/${yourUserName}/.gradle
On Windows this is usually C:\Users\${yourUserName}\.gradle

On Mac this is usually /Users/${yourUserName}/.gradle

Inside this _.gradle_ folder a _gradle.properties_ file with the following contents has to be created.

[source,java]
----
include::res/daemon/gradle.properties[]
----

=== Validate

Open a command line and again run the `gradle` command.

This time the following message should not be present at the end of the build any more.

[source,java]
----
include::res/daemon/daemon-notice.txt[]
----
