== Dependency management for Java projects

=== Managing dependencies with Gradle

(((Gradle,Dependencies)))
(((Gradle, Specifying dependencies)))
(((Gradle,classpath)))

Gradle allows managing the classpath of your projects. 
It can add JAR files, directories or other projects to the build path of your application.
It also supports the automatic download of your Java library dependencies. 
Simply specify the dependency in your Gradle build file. 
This triggers Gradle to download the library including its transient dependencies during the build.

A Java library is identified by Gradle via its projectâ€™s `groupId:artifactId:version` (also known as GAV in Maven).
This GAV uniquely identifies a library in a certain version.
You can use the http://search.maven.org/[Search Maven Website] to search for the GAV of a library in Maven Central.

To add a dependency add an entry to the dependency section in your build.gradle file as demonstrated by the following listing.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/dependencies/dep.txt[]
----

=== Specifying the repositories to search for dependencies

In your build file you specify the remote repositories to look for dependencies. 
Gradle supports Maven and Ivy repositories to search for dependencies. 
The following listing shows how to configure Maven central as dependency source.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/dependencies/maven1.txt[]
----

It is also possible to configure the target as a URL.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/dependencies/maven2.txt[]
----

You can also specify other targets, for example Bintray as Maven repository.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/dependencies/jcenter.txt[]
----

The next listing demonstrates how to define an Ivy dependency. 

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/dependencies/ivy.txt[]
----

You can also add different repositories at once.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/dependencies/multiple_jfrog_maven.txt[]
----

You can also reference artifacts from the file system.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/java/build_file_deps.gradle[]
----

=== Gradle cache and deleting the cache

You can refresh dependencies in your cache with the command line option `--refresh-dependencies`. 
You can also delete the cached files under _~/.gradle/caches_ . 
With the next build Gradle attempts to download the dependencies again.
