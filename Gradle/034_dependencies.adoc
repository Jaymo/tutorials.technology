			Gradle allows managing the classpath of your projects. It can add JAR files, directories or other projects to
			the build path of your application. It also
			supports the automatic download
			of
			your
			Java library dependencies. Simply
			specify the dependency in your Gradle build
			file. This triggers Gradle
			to
			download
			the
			library including its
			transient
			dependencies during the build.

		
		
			A Java library is identified by Gradle via its projectâ€™s
			`groupId:artifactId:version`
			(also known as GAV in Maven). This
			GAV uniquely identifies a library in a certain version. You can for example
			<ulink url="http://search.maven.org/">Search Maven</ulink>
			to search for the GAV of a library in Maven Central.
		


		To add a dependency add an entry to the dependency section in your build.gradle file as demonstrated by the
			following listing.
		

		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/dependencies/dep.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
	<section id="gradeintro_addingrepositories">
		<title>Specifying the repositories to search for dependencies
		
			In your build
			file you specify the remote
			repositories to look
			for dependencies. Gradle supports Maven and Ivy
			repositories to search for dependencies. The following listing shows how to
			configure
			Maven
			central as
			dependency
			source.
		
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/dependencies/maven1.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

		It is also possible to configure the target as a URL.
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/dependencies/maven2.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

		You can also specify other targets, for example Bintray as Maven repository.
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/dependencies/jcenter.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		The next listing demonstrates how to define an Ivy dependency. 
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/dependencies/ivy.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		You can also add different repositories at once.
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
					href="./examples/dependencies/multiple_jfrog_maven.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		You can also reference artifacts from the file system.
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/java/build_file_deps.gradle" />
			</programlisting>
		
	


	<section id="gradeintro_cache">
		<title>Gradle cache and deleting the cache
		
			You can refresh dependencies in your cache with the command line option
			`--refresh-dependencies`
			. You
			can also delete the cached files under
			_~/.gradle/caches_
			. With the next build Gradle attempts to download
			the dependencies again.
