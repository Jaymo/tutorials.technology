		The Gradle build system uses plug-ins to extend its core
		functionality. A plug-in is an
		extension to Gradle which
		typically adds
		some preconfigured
		tasks.
		Gradle ships with a number
		of plug-ins, and
		you can develop your
		custom plug-ins.
	
	
		One example is the Java plug-in.
		This
		plug-in adds
		tasks to
		your
		project which allow compiling
		Java source code, run
		unit tests
		and to create a JAR file.
	
	
		A plug-in is included in a
		<filename>build.gradle</filename>
		file with the
		<code>apply plugin: 'pluginname'</code>
		statement.
	
	
		For example the entry
		<code>apply plugin: 'com.android.application'</code>
		makes the Android plug-in available for a Gradle build.
	
	
		Gradle provides also a registry for plug-ins via
		<ulink url="http://plugins.gradle.org/">Gradle Plugin search</ulink>
		.
