		When starting a Gradle build via the command line, the
		`gradle`
		command tool looks for a file called
		_build.gradle_
		in the current directory.
	
	
		Gradle also supports abbreviation of tasks, e.g,. to start the task
		`lars`
		using the
		`gradle l`
		command is sufficient. The abbreviation must uniquely identify a task,
		otherwise an error, which tell that the
		abbreviation is ambiguous,
		will raise.
		CamelCase can also be used for an abbreviation, e.g., the
		task
		`gradle vogellaCompany`
		can also be called like this:
		`gradle vC`
	
	
		A Gradle build can be triggered via the
		`gradle`
		or
		`gradle -q`
		command. The
		`-q`
		or
		`--quite`
		parameter
		makes the execution of Gradle less verbose. A specific task
		can be addressed like this:
		`gradle -q other`
		, which runs the "other" task. Alternatively to the
		`gradle`
		command the Gradle wrapper can be used.
	
	
		To define a different build file the
		`-b buildFileName`
		option can be used.
	

	
		In scenarios where no network connection is available the
		`--offline`
		parameter can be used. This lets Gradle run offline, which means that
		Gradle does not try to reach resources from the
		network during a
		build. (e.g., additional dependencies from an artifact repository like Maven Central or Bintray)
	
	
		To get a detailed output of what Gradle is doing you can specify the
		`--info`
	
	parameter.
