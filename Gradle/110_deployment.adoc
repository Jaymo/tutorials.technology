=== Using the maven-publish plugin
		
			The most common way is to use the
			`maven-publish`
			plugin, which is provides by Gradle by default.
		
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/deployment/maven_plugin_local.gradle[]
----
		
		
			There are several publish options, when the
			`java`
			and the
			`maven-publish`
			plugin is applied.
