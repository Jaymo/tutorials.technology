== Installing and configuring Gradle
(((Gradle, Installation)))

=== Requirements

The usage of Gradle requires an JDK (Java Development Kit) installation.
	
=== Download Gradle
		
The latest version of Gradle can be found on the http://gradle.org/gradle-download[Gradle Download page].
Download the latest _Complete distribution_ of Gradle from http://gradle.org/gradle-download[Gradle Download page]
		
		
It is a gradle-${version}-all.zip, where ${version} is a placeholder for the current version, e.g., _gradle-2.13-all.zip_.
		
=== Installing Gradle on Windows
		
Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to _C:\Program Files_ or a different location. 
This will for example result in a _C:\Program Files\gradle-2.13_ folder.
		
		
Afterwards add the _C:\Program Files\${version}_ folder, e.g., _C:\Program Files\gradle-2.13_ to your `PATH` environment variable.
		
By pressing Win + Pause the system settings can be opened.

First the _Advanced System Settings_ have to be selected and then the _Environment Variables_ button needs to be pressed.

In the _Environment Variables_ dialog the (1) GRADLE_HOME and JAVA_HOME user variables should be set.
After that the (2) Path entry in the _system variables_ is selected, the _modify_ button can be pressed to add the _bin_ folder of the Gradle installation to the Path.

=== Installing Gradle on Linux/Mac
		
Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to _/opt/gradle_ or a different location. 
This will for example result in a _/opt/gradle/gradle-2.13_ folder.
		
		
The `JAVA_HOME` variable must point to a proper jdk and `$JAVA_HOME/bin` must be part of the PATH environment variable.
		
		
Add Gradle to the path by running `export PATH=/usr/local/gradle/gradle-2.13/bin:$PATH` in a terminal.
		
=== Validate
		
Open a command line and type `gradle` , which will run Gradle's help task by default.

=== Using the Gradle daemon for improved startup time
		
Gradle allows to start Gradle as daemon to avoid starting the Java virtual machine for every build. 
To configure that create a file called _gradle.properties_ in the _${HOME}/.gradle_ and add the following line to it.gradle.properties.
		
[source,console]
----
include::res/install/gradle.properties[]
----
		

		
You can also place the _gradle.properties_ file to the root directory of your project and commit it to your version control system.
		
If Gradle is not used for a few hours, the daemon stops automatically.
		
		
Executing gradle with the `--daemon` parameter on the command line starts the gradle daemon.
		
		
To stop the daemon interactively use the `gradle --stop` command.
		
	

=== Specify custom JVM settings for Gradle

The GRADLE_OPTS environment variable offers the opportunity to set specific JVM options for Gradle.
		
In  <<gradeinstallation_demon>> the performance for the JVM startup is improved, but another performance killer for large builds can be a too small maximum heap space. 
Therefore it makes sense to increase it for Gradle.
		
		
`export GRADLE_OPTS=-Xmx1024m`
defines that Gradle can use 1 GB as maximum heap size.
		
On Windows OS environment variables are usually defined via the system property UI.
		
	
=== Typical .gitignore file for Gradle projects
		
If you are using Git as version control system, you can use the following _.gitignore_ file as template for a Gradle project.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/git/gitignore[]
----
