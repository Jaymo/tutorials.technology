		<title>Installing Gradle for the usage on the command line

		
			The lastest version of Gradle can be found here:
			<ulink url="http://gradle.org/gradle-download/">http://gradle.org/gradle-download/</ulink>
		
		
			How to properly install Gradle is explained in the next exercise. See
			<xref linkend="exercise_installgradle" />
		
		
			The configuration can be tested by typing in
			`gradle`
			into the command line.

		<title>Using the Gradle daemon for improved startup time
		
			Gradle allows to start Gradle as daemon to avoid starting the Java
			virtual machine for every build. To configure that
			create a file
			called
			_gradle.properties_
			in the
			_${HOME}/.gradle_
			and add the following line to it.gradle.properties
		
		
			<programlisting language="plain">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/install/gradle.properties" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			You can also place the
			_gradle.properties_
			file to the root
			directory of your project and commit it to your
			version control system.
		
		If Gradle is not used for a few hours, the daemon stops
			automatically.
		
		
			Executing gradle with the
			`--daemon`
			parameter
			on the command line
			starts the gradle daemon.
		
		
			To stop the daemon interactively use the
			`gradle --stop`
			command.

	<section id="GRADLE_OPTS">
		<title>Specify custom JVM settings for Gradle
		The GRADLE_OPTS environment variable offers the opportunity to
			set specific JVM options for Gradle.
		
		
			In section
			<xref linkend="gradeinstallation_demon" />
			the performance for the JVM startup is improved, but another
			performance killer for large builds can be a too small
			maximum heap
			space. Therefore it makes sense to increase it for Gradle.
		
		
			`export GRADLE_OPTS=-Xmx1024m`
			defines that Gradle can use 1 GB as maximum heap size.
		
		On Windows OS environment variables are usually defined via the
			system property UI.

		<title>Typical .gitignore file for Gradle projects
		
			If you are using Git as version control system, you can use the
			following
			_.gitignore_
			file as template for a Gradle project.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
