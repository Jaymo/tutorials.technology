== Introduction to the Gradle build system

=== What is the Gradle build system?
(((Gradle)))

_Gradle_ is an advanced general purpose build management system based on Groovy and Kotlin.
Gradle supports the automatic download and configuration of dependencies or other libraries. 
It supports Maven and Ivy repositories for retrieving these dependencies. 
This allows reusing the artifacts of existing build systems.

Gradle supports multi-project and multi-artifact builds.

Gradle has the notion of _projects_ and _tasks_.


[[gradle_projectstasks]]
=== Projecs and tasks in Gradle

A Gradle build consists of one or more _projects_.
Projects can be something which should be built or something that should be done. 
Each project consists of _tasks_. 
A task represents a piece of work which a build performs, e.g., compile the source code or generate the Javadoc.

=== The Gradle build file - build.gradle

A project using Gradle describes its build via a _build.gradle_ file. 
This file is located in the root folder of the project.
The build file for Gradle builds is based on a_Domain Specific Language_ (DSL). 
In this file you can use a combination of declarative and imperative statements.
You can also write Groovy or Kotlin code, whenever you need it. 
Tasks can also be created and extended dynamically at runtime.


This build file defines a project and its tasks. 
Gradle is a general purpose build system hence this build file can perform any task. 
The following listing represents a very simple build file.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/starter/build_hello.gradle[]
----

This build file can also be simplified << can be used as shortcut to define the `doLast` statement.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/starter/build_hello2.gradle[]
----


To execute the `hello` task in this build file, type `gradle hello` on the command line in the directory of the build file. 
If the Gradle output should be suppressed, use the `-q` (quite) parameter.

[source,console]
----
include::res/starter/runbuild.gradle[]
----

[[gradle_runbuild_buildfile_comments]]

=== Comments in Gradle build files
You can use single and multiline comments in Gradle build files.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/comments/example.gradle[]
----

=== Project settings and description

By default, Gradle uses the directory name as project name. 
You can change this by creating a _settings.gradle_ file in the directory which specifies the project name.


[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/settings.gradle[]
----



You can also add a description to your project via the _build.gradle_ file.


[source,gradle]
----
include::res/settings/build.gradle[]
----

Use the `gradle project` command to get information about your project. 
The following listing shows the output.

[source,console]
----
include::res/settings/settings.output[]
----

	

=== IDE support for Gradle
	
The Gradleware company is developing Eclipse Gradle tooling via the Eclipse Buildship project.
Other IDEs like IntelliJ and Android Studio already include also good Gradle support. 
See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html[Eclipse Gradle tutorial] for the usage of Gradle with Eclipse.
