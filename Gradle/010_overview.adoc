			_Gradle_
			is an advanced general purpose build management system based
			on
			Groovy.
			Gradle supports the automatic download and
			configuration of project dependencies
			(libraries). It supports
			Maven and Ivy
			repositories
			for
			retrieving these
			dependencies. This
			allows reusing the artifacts of
			existing
			build systems.
		
		Gradle supports
			multi-project and
			multi-artifact
			builds.
		
		
			Gradle has the notion of
			_projects_
			and
			_tasks_
			.

		<title>Projecs and tasks in Gradle
		A Gradle build
		consists of one or more projects. Projects can be
		something which
		should be built or something that
		should
		be done. Each
		project consists of tasks. A task represents a piece of
		work which
		a build performs, e.g., compile
		the
		source code or generate the
		Javadoc.

		<title>The Gradle build file - build.gradle
		<indexterm>
			<primary>build.gradle</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			A
			project using Gradle describes its build via a
			_build.gradle_
			file. This file is located
			in the root folder of the project.
			The build file for Gradle builds is based on a
			_Domain Specific Language_
			(DSL) written in Groovy. In this file you can use a combination of
			declarative and
			imperative statements, as
			well as
			writing
			Groovy code
			whenever you need it. Tasks can also be created dynamically.
		
		
			This build file
			defines a project and
			its
			tasks. Gradle is a general purpose build
			system hence this build
			file
			can
			perform any task. The following listing represents a very simple build file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/starter/build_hello.gradle" />
			</programlisting>
		
		This
			build file can also be simplified <![CDATA[<<]]>
			can be used as shortcut to define the
			`doLast`
			statement.
		
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/starter/build_hello2.gradle" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			To execute the
			`hello`
			task in this build file, type
			`gradle hello`
			on the command line in the directory of the build file. If the Gradle output should be suppressed, use the
			`-q`
			(quite)
			parameter.
		

		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/starter/runbuild.gradle" />

		<title>Project settings and description
		
			By default, Gradle uses the directory name as project name. You can
			change this by creating a
			_settings.gradle_
			file in the directory which specifies the project name.
		
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/settings/settings.gradle" />

			You can also add a description to your project via the
			_build.gradle_
			file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="gradle">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/settings/build.gradle" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Use the
			`gradle project`
			command to get information about your project. The following listing
			shows the output.
		
		
			<programlisting language="plain">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/settings/settings.output" />
