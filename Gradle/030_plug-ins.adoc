== Gradle plug-ins
(((Gradle, Plug-ins)))
	
The Gradle build system uses plug-ins to extend its core functionality.
A plug-in is an extension to Gradle which typically adds some preconfigured tasks.
Gradle ships with a number of plug-ins, and you can develop custom plug-ins.
	
	
One example is the Java plug-in.
This plug-in adds tasks to your project which allow compiling Java source code, run unit tests and to create a JAR file.
	
A plug-in is included in a _build.gradle_ file with the `apply plugin: 'pluginname'` statement.
	
For example the entry `apply plugin: 'com.android.application'` makes the Android plug-in available for a Gradle build.
	
	
Gradle provides also a registry for plug-ins via http://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin search].
