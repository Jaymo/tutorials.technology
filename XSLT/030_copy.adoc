== Your first transformation - copy

We start first with the simplest transformation possible; no transformation at all. 
Create a new directory called `com.vogella.xslt.first`. 
Create a folder `files`.

Create the following XML file `source.xml` in the `files` folder.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/source.xml[]
----

Create the following
`transform.xsl`
file
in the
`files`
folder.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/transform.xsl[]
----

To run the transformation, use the following command on the command line.

[source,bourne]
----
include::res/xsltproc/transform.txt[]
----

Review the generated `result.xml` file. 
It should be a copy of the input file.
