== Build tools
	
		In software development the term
		<wordasword>building</wordasword>
		usually means the conversion of source code and other artifacts, like images or configuration files, into another
		artifact. For example source code might be compiled into a JAR file. Or you may create a new standalone application.
		The build result can
		be shared with
		users of the
		software or used only internally.
	
	
		A
		<wordasword>build tools</wordasword>
		is"EclipseTycho/001_article.xml"
		used to
		automate repetitive tasks during this process. This
		can be, for example,
		compiling
		source code,
		running
		software
		tests and
		creating
		files and
		documentation
		for the
		software
		deployment.
	
	
		Build
		tools typically run without a graphical user interface
		directly from the command line. As a user interface is not
		required to such builds, these builds are called
		<wordasword>headless</wordasword>
		.
	
	
		Popular build tools in the Java space are
		<wordasword>Maven</wordasword>
		and
		<wordasword>Gradle</wordasword>
		and <wordasword>Apache Ant</wordasword>.
