	<section id="antexample_overview">
=== Using Ant for Java development
		
			The following describes how you compile Java classes, create an
			executable JAR file and create Javadoc for your project with Apache
			Ant. The following example assumes that your are using the Eclipse
			IDE to manage your
			Java project and your Ant build.
		

	<section id="antexample_javaproject">
=== Create Java project
		
			Create a Java project called
			_de.vogella.build.ant.first_
			in
			Eclipse. Create a package called
			_math_
			and the following class.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/ant/MyMath.java[]
----
		
		
			Create the
			`test`
			package and the following class.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/ant/Main.java[]
----
		

	<section id="antexample_buildxml">
=== Create build.xml
		
			Create a new File through the
menu:File[New > File]
			menu and create the
			`build.xml`
			file. Implement the following code to this file.
		
		

[source,xml]
----
include::res/ant/build.xml[]
----
		
		 The code is documented, you should be able to determine the
			purpose of the different ant tasks via the documentation in the
			coding.
		

	<section id="antexample_eclipserun">
=== Run your Ant build from Eclipse
		
			Run the
			`build.xml`
			file as an
			_Ant Build_
			in Eclipse.

			After this process your data structure should look like this:

	<section id="antexample_run">
=== Run your Ant build from the command line
		 Open a command line and switch to your project directory. Type
			in the following commands.
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/ant/run.txt[]
----
		

		The build should finish successfully and generate the build
			artifacts.
