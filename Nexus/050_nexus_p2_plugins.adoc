These two downloaded `bundle.zip` files, which contain the nexus plugins have to be extracted into the `sonatype-work/nexus/plugin-repository` folder of the Nexus installation.

The nexus server has to be restarted to install the plugins.

`./bin/nexus restart`

To validate that these plugins are properly installed the plugin
console can be used.
