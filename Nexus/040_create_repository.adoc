== Creating a repository

We want to have a separate repository for our p2 artifacts.
This can be created like this:

* Login to the nexus 
+
....
http://localhost:8081/nexus/ 
....
+
with User `admin` and password `admin123`.
* Click on Repositories on the right hand side.
* Select menu:Add..[Hosted Repository] and use the following data:

Now you got a custom repository, which is hosted on your local nexus installation.
