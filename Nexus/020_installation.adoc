== Installation of Nexus

In order to install the open source version of Nexus you need to visit
http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/go/[Nexus OSS]
and download the TGZ
version or the ZIP version. Currently the latest version is 2.11.4-01.

In order to extract the archive use
`﻿$ tar xvzf nexus-2.11.4-01-bundle.tar.gz`

To start Nexus, after extracting, the
`nexus`
script must be
executed with a
`start`
parameter in the
`nexus`
folder:

`﻿﻿cd /NEXUS_FOLDER/nexus ./bin/nexus start`

And in case you want to stop Nexus you just have to write stop instead of start:

`﻿﻿cd /NEXUS_FOLDER/nexus ./bin/nexus stop`
