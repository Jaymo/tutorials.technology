== Travis CI

Travis CI is a really build server for projects hosted on https://github.com/[GitHub], where the projects easily can be tested and deployed. Even pull requests (PRs) can be built automatically with Travis CI.

It is available here: https://travis-ci.org/

For Open Source projects on https://github.com/[GitHub] the Travis CI service is for free.
