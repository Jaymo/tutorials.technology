== Using a display during the build

In order to use and test a UI toolkit during the build _xvfb_ can be used.

It can be activated in the _.travis.yml_ file with the following `before_script` statement.

[source, yml]
----
# Specify a display with xvfb for UI testing
before_script:
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"
  - sleep 3 # give xvfb some time to start
----
