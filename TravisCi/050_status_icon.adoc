== Showing a status icon

To let the users trust in the library the build status determined by Travis CI is often shown in public.

In order to do this simply click on the build status icon and choose from several options for embedding the status icon.

In the _Status Image_ dialog a status from a certain branch can be queried.

And besides _ASCIIDOC_ there are many other templates for formats to embed the icon:

* IMAGE_URL
* MARKDOWN
* TEXTILE
* RDOC
* ASCIIDOC
* RST
* POD
* CCTRAY
