=== Signature for macros
		 If you want to use macros automatically in Outlook you need to
			sign them. You can sign your macros directly from the Visual Basic
			editor via the menu "Tools -> Digital Signature". The dialog allows
			you to sign your project. 
		
		If you restart Outlook and run your macro you might receive a
			warning but the macro should run. You might have to change your
			security settings under "Tools -> Trust Center on the tab macros".
