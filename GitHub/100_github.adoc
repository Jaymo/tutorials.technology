=== What is GitHub?
(((GitHub)))
GitHub
is a popular hosting provider for Git repositories. GitHub
provides also additional services around these repositories, for
example an issue tracker for each repository, build server
integration and more.

GitHub supports that repositories can be cloned
to a new Git
repository hosted at Github. GitHub uses the term
_fork_
or
_forking_
for creating such clones.

GitHub
provides
free hosting for publicly visible
Git
repositories.
A
public
repository can be cloned by other people
at
any point in
time.

If the repository should not be visible to everyone, Git allows
to create private repositories, but you must pay for this service a
monthly rate.
Private repository allows you to
specify the
people which
have access
to the
repository and to define their access
rights.

GitHub can be found
under the following
URL: https://github.com[GitHub]

If you create an account at GitHub, you can create a repository.
After
creating a repository at GitHub, you will get a description of
all the
commands you need
to execute to upload your project to GitHub.
Follow
the
instructions below.

These instructions will be similar to the following commands.

GitHub allows you to use SSH based or HTTPS based authentication
to
access your
repositories. To clone, pull or fetch from a public
available repository no authentication is required.

=== Create repository in GitHub

Once you create a user at Github, you can create a new public
repository. For example the following screenshots demonstrate the
creation of
the
_de.vogella.git.github_
repository.

After creation of your new repository GitHub displays the
information what you have to
do if you want to connect to this
repository via the command line. As
we are going to use
EGit you can
ignore this information.

environment and push the changes to this fork at GitHub.

Afterwards you can create a pull request for the repository you
