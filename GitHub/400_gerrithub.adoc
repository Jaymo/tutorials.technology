== Using Gerrit through GerritHub

http://gerrithub.io[GerritHub] is a service that allows you to use http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Gerrit/article.html[Gerrit] for code reviews for your GitHub repositories.
It works by cloning your repositories to it's servers and allows you to push Gerrit changes to them.
Merged Gerrit changes are synced back to GitHub.

=== Authorizing GerritHub

To use the service you have to Sign in with your GitHub account.
Open up http://gerrithub.io and press btn:[First time Sign In].

You can then choose if you want to give GerritHub access to your private or only your public repositories.
GerritHub then asks for the following authorizations:

* Read-only access to your email adresses
* Read and write acess to your public (and possibly private) repositories
* Read-only access to your organizations
You have to accept to proceed.

After finalizing your account information you are then ready to use GerritHub.
In the next step you can choose which repositories you want to import and have the possibility to import existing pull requests.

=== Importing a repository from GitHub

To import a repository from GitHub, first open Gerrit on GerritHub: https://review.gerrithub.io.
Now choose menu:GitHub[Repositories].

Select all repositories that you want to import and click on the btn:[Next] button.
The next page lets you select which existing pull requests you want to import as Gerrit changes.

=== Importing pull requests from GitHub

It is possible to import existing pull requests from GitHub as Gerrit changes.
Please be aware that changes made to the pull request after the import won't propagate to the Gerrit change.
You can import the pull request again but this will create a new Gerrit change instead of updating the old Gerrit change.

To import pull requests from GitHub open Gerrit on GerritHub: https://review.gerrithub.io.
Now choose menu:GitHub[Pull Requests].

Select all pull requests you want to import and then press the btn:[Next] button.

=== Pushing a commit to GerritHub for code review

Once you have imported your GitHub resources into GerritHub you can use it like any other Gerrit instance.
After you merged a change GerritHub will automatically try to push it back to GitHub.
For information on how to use Gerrit please see our http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Gerrit/article.html#gerritreview_configuration[Gerrit tutorial].


=== Keeping the repositories in sync

If you are only using GerritHub to push changes you don't have to do anything additional.
GerritHub automatically propagates merged changes back to GitHub.
If you or someone else pushes changes directly to GitHub you have to manually sync this changes to GerritHub.
Assuming you have set GitHub as your `origin` remote and `gerrithub` as your GerritHub remote:

[source, terminal]
----
git pull master
git push gerrithub master
----
