=== Selecting the multi-processing module
	
The Apache HTTP server provides a selection of Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs). 
These are responsible for binding to network ports on the machine, accepting requests, and dispatching children to handle the requests. 
On Ubuntu you can select one of them via one of the following commands.

----
# install the event MPM
# this is supposted to be less resource intensive
sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-event

# install the worker MPM
sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-worker

# install the worker MPM
sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork
