=== What are virtual hosts in Apache?

Virtual hosts allow Apache2 to be configured for multiple sites that have separate configurations.

This allows you to have one Apache HTTP web server running on one IP serving multiple domains.

=== How to configure vhosts under Ubuntu

Under Ubuntu you create a configuration file in the `/etc/apache2/sites-available` folder, for example the `vogella.conf`.

[source]
----
include::res/vhosts/www.vogella.com[]
----

You enable or disable virtual hosts with the following command.

[source]
----
#enable the vhost
sudo a2ensite vogella.conf

#disable the vhost
sudo a2dissite www.vogella.com
----

After enabling sites you have to reload the Apache HTTP server configuration with the `sudo service apache2 reload` command.
