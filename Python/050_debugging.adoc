== Debugging

Just right-click in the source code and add a breakpoint.

You can now inspect and modify the variables in the variables view.

Via the debug buttons (or shortcuts kbd:[F5], kbd:[F6], kbd:[F7], kbd:[F8]) you can move in
your program.

You can use kbd:[F5] / kbd:[F6], kbd:[F7] and kbd:[F8] to step through your coding.

|===
|Command |Description

|kbd:[F5] 
|Goes to the next step in your program. 
If the next step is a method / function this command will jump into the associated code. 

|kbd:[F6] 
|F6 will step over the call, e.g. it will call a method / function without entering the associated code.  

|kbd:[F7]
|F7 will go to the caller of the method/ function. 
So this will leave the current code and go to the calling code.  

|kbd:[F8]
|Use F8 to go to the next breakpoint. If no further
breakpoint is encountered then the program will normally run.

You can of course use the ui to debug. The following displays
the key bindings for the debug buttons.
