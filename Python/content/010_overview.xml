=== What is Python
		
			_Python_
			is an interpreted programming language and claims to be a
			very
			effective programming language.
			_Python_
			was develop by Guido van
			Rossum.
		
		
			The name Python is
			based on the TV show called
			_Monty Python's Flying Circus_
			. During execution the Python source code is translated
			into
			bytecode
			which is then interpreted by the
			_Python_
			interpreter.
			_Python_
			source code
			can also run on the Java Virtual Machine, in
			this
			case you
			are using
			Jython.
		
		
			Key features of
			_Python_
			are:
			
				<listitem>
					high-level data types, as for example extensible
						lists
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					statement grouping is done by indentation instead of
						brackets
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					variable or argument declaration is not necessary 
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					supports for object-orientated, procedural and
						functional
						programming style
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

=== Block concept in
			_Python_
			via indentation
		
			_Python_
			identify
			blocks of code by
			indentation. If you
			have
			an if statement and
			the next line is indented
			then it means that
			this indented
			block belongs
			to the if. The Python
			interpreter supports
			either spaces or tabs, e.g.
			you can not mix
			both. The most "pythonic"
			way is to use 4 spaces
			per
			indentation
			level.

=== About this tutorial
		This tutorial will first explain how to install Python and the
			Python plugins for Eclipse. It will then create a small Python
			project to show the usage of the plugin. Afterwards the general
			constructs of Python are explained.
