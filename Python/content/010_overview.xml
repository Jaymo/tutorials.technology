			The name Python is
			based on the TV show called
			<wordasword>Monty Python's Flying Circus</wordasword>
			. During execution the Python source code is translated
			into
			bytecode
			which is then interpreted by the
			<wordasword>Python</wordasword>
			interpreter.
			<wordasword>Python</wordasword>
			source code
			can also run on the Java Virtual Machine, in
			this
			case you
			are using
			Jython.

		<title>Block concept in
			<wordasword>Python</wordasword>
			via indentation</title>
		<para>
			<wordasword>Python</wordasword>
			identify
			blocks of code by
			indentation. If you
			have
			an if statement and
			the next line is indented
			then it means that
			this indented
			block belongs
			to the if. The Python
			interpreter supports
			either spaces or tabs, e.g.
			you can not mix
			both. The most "pythonic"
			way is to use 4 spaces
			per
			indentation
			level.
