=== Overview</title>
		<para>
			Apache Hadoop is a software solution for distributed computing of
			large datasets. Hadoop provides a distributed filesystem (HDFS) and a
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/MapReduce/article.html">MapReduce</ulink>
			implementation.
		</para>
		<para>A special computer acts as the "name node". This computer saves
			the information about the available clients and the files. The Hadoop
			clients (computers) are called nodes. </para>
		<para> The "name node" is currently a single point of failure. The
			Hadoop project is working on solutions for this. </para>

=== Typical tasks</title>
		<para> Apache Hadoop can be used to filter and aggregate data, e.g. a
			typical use case would be the analysis of web server logs file to find
			the most visited pages. But MapReduce has been use to transverse the
			graphs and other tasks.</para>

=== Writing the map and reduce functions</title>
		<para>
			Hadoop allow that map and reduce functions are written in Java.
			Hadoop provides also linker so that map and reduce functions can be
			written in other languages, e.g. C++, Python, Per, etc.
