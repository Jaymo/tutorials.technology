== Apache Hadoop
	<section id="overview">
=== Overview
		
			Apache Hadoop is a software solution for distributed computing of
			large datasets. Hadoop provides a distributed filesystem (HDFS) and a
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/MapReduce/article.html[MapReduce</ulink>
			implementation.
		
		A special computer acts as the "name node". This computer saves
			the information about the available clients and the files. The Hadoop
			clients (computers) are called nodes. 
		 The "name node" is currently a single point of failure. The
			Hadoop project is working on solutions for this.

=== Typical tasks
		 Apache Hadoop can be used to filter and aggregate data, e.g. a
			typical use case would be the analysis of web server logs file to find
			the most visited pages. But MapReduce has been use to transverse the
			graphs and other tasks.

=== Writing the map and reduce functions
		
			Hadoop allow that map and reduce functions are written in Java.
			Hadoop provides also linker so that map and reduce functions can be
			written in other languages, e.g. C++, Python, Per, etc.
