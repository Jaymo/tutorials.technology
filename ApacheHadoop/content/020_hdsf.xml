== Hadoop file system</title>
	<para>
		The Hadoop file system (HDSF) is a distribute file system. It use
		an
		existing file system of the operating system but extends this with
		redundancy and distribution. HSDF hides the complexity of distributed
		storage and redundancy from the programmer. 
	</para>
	<para> In the standard configuration HDFS saves all files three times
		on different nodes. The "name node" (server) has the information where
		the files are stored.  </para>
	<para> Harddisks are very effective
		in reading large files sequentially
		but getting much slower during random access. HDFS is therefore
		optimized for large files.  </para>
	<para> To improve performance Hadoop also tries to move the computation
		to the nodes which store the data and not vice versa. Especially if
		you have very large data this helps to improve the performance as you
		can avoid that the network becomes the bottleneck. </para>
