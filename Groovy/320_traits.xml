== Traits
	
		Traits are reusable components of behavior that your classes can
		implement, and are an additional Object-Oriented concept alongside
		classes and interfaces. Replaced
		`@Mixin`
		.

	A trait can have properties, unlike Java 8 default methods for
		interfaces.

----
	

	A class can implements several traits. To avoid multiple
		inheritance the last inherited trait wins, unless the class overrides
		the method or property directly.
	
	Traits support inheritance, e.g., a trait can extend another
		trait
		or implement an interface.
