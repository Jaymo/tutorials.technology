[[datatypes_maps]]
== Maps in Groovy

[[datatypes_maps1]]
=== Map declaration and access
Groovy treads maps as first class constructs in the language.

The items of maps are keyâ€“value pairs
that are delimited by
colons. An
empty map
can be created via `[:]`. By default a map is of the
`java.util.HashMap`
type. If the keys are of type String, you can avoid
the single or
double quotes in the map declaration.

[source,java]
----
include::res/maps/MapTest.groovy[]
----

The values of a mapped value can
get
accessed
via map[key].
Assignment
can
be done via map[key]=value. You can also call
`get(key)`
or
`get(key,default)`. 
In the second case, if the key is not found and the default is
returned, the
(key,default) pair
is added to the
map.

The
`keySet()`
method returns a set of
keys, a collection without duplicate entries
and no guaranteed ordering.

[[datatypes_maps2]]
=== Each, any and the every method

You can call closures on the elements, via the
`each()`,
`any()`
and
`every()`
method. The
`any()`
and
`every()`
methods return a boolean depending whether any or every entry in the
map satisfies a condition defined by a closure.

include::res/maps/CallMethods.groovy[]

As you can see in the above example you can iterate in different
ways through a map. The parameter for each can by one parameter and
than it is the map entry or two in which case it is the key, value
combination.

[[datatypes_map_search]]
=== Searching in a map

You can also use the following methods:

* findAll(closure) - Finds all entries satisfying the condition defined by the closure
* find(closure) - Find the first entry satisfying the condition defined by the closure
* collect(closure) - Returns a list based on the map with the values returned by the closure
* submap('key1', 'key2', ) - returns a map based on the entries of the listed keys

[[datatypes_map_adding]]
=== Getting and adding defaults values via the get method

The
`get(key, default_value)`
allows to add the "default_value" to the map and return it to the
caller, if the element identified by "key" is not found in the map.
The
`get(key)`
method, does not add automatically to the map.

[[datatypes_map_namedparameters]]
=== Named arguments for method invocation

It is possible to use named arguments in method invocation.

[source,java]
----
include::res/namedarguments/TestNamedArgument.groovy[]
----

All named arguments are used are converted by Groovy them a map
and passed into
the
method as first parameter. All other parameters
are
passed in
afterwards. The method can now extract the parameter
from the
map and
perform its setup.

[[datatypes_map_converttolist]]
=== Convert a list to a map

To convert a list to a map you can use the
`collectEntries`
method.
