== Expando

The
`Expando`
class allows that
properties and new methods are added
at runtime to an instance of it. The new method must be defined
as
closure. It uses the Groovy meta object protocol for that.

This is demonstrated by the following example.

[source,java]
----
include::res/expando/test.groovy[]
----

Espandos are useful for creating on the fly objects with certain properties and methods and can be used in
testing for parameters which do not define their type.
