=== Optional typed variables
		
			Variables and fields can be typed as in Java or your can use the
			`def`
			keyword to define a variable. As a rule of thumb, use the type if it
			adds clarity to your code otherwise use
			`def`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/explained/Type.groovy" />
			</programlisting>
		
		At runtime variables and fields are always typed, Groovy infers
			the type based on your source code. This means
			that at runtime you
			receive an error if you try to assign a non fitting type to a
			variable.
		
		Variables which are not declared can be used in Groovy scripts
			to indicate that they can be set from outside.
			Such declarations are
			only valid in scripts and become part of the scripts binding.

	<section id="groovyobjects_generics">
=== Groovy and generics
		
			Groovy supports the syntax of generics but does not enforce it. For example, you can put any type into a
			`<![CDATA[List<Integer>]]>`
			collection. To enforce type checking in Groovy you can use AST transformations. See
			<xref linkend="asttransformations" />
			to learn more about AST transformations.

	<section id="datatypes_overview">
=== All types are objects
		 All variables in Groovy are objects (reference variables),
			Groovy does not use primitive variables. Groovy still
			allows to use
			the primitives types as a short form for the variable declaration but
			the compiler
			translates this into
			the object.

	<section id="datatypes_numbers">
=== Numbers

		Numbers are objects in Groovy, as well as variables defined as
			int, float, double, etc. If you use numbers in
			your code Groovy
			assigns a
			type
			to it
			and performs automatically the down- and
			upcasting
			for you.
		
		
			As numbers are object they have also methods for example the
			`times`
			method which executes a block of code the number of times defined by
			the number.
		
		
			Create the following class called
			`TypesTest`
			to play with numbers.

		The operators, like + or - are also mapped to methods by Groovy.

	<section id="datatypes_ranges">
=== Ranges
		
			Groovy supports the
			`Range`
			data type is a
			`Collection`
			. Ranges consists of two values separated by two dots. Ranges can for
			example be used to define a loop statement.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/datatypes/RangesTest.groovy" />
			</programlisting>
		
		You can use Strings for the definition of ranges, these ranges
			follow the alphabet.
		

		
			Every object can be used as
			`Range`
			long as it
			implements the
			`previous()`
			and
			`next()`
			methods and the
			`java.util.Comparable`
			interface. The methods map to the
			++ and -- operators.
