== Eclipse RCP

It is possible to use Groovy code within Eclipse RCP
applications. For
this install the Groovy tooling into your Eclipse
IDE and make them
available in your target platform. Afterwards:

* Add the Groovy nature to the plug-in which should contain Groovy
code via right-mouse click on the project and by selecting
menu:Configure[Convert to Groovy Project]. 
This adds the Groovy libraries to the project.

* Add the
`org.codehaus.groovy`
plug-in to the dependencies of
the plug-in that contains
Groovy code.

* Develop some Groovy code
* Add `org.codehaus.groovy` and its dependencies to your Eclipse RCP product configuration file.

That is sufficient create an RCP application which uses Groovy.
