			The
			<wordasword>Meta-Object Protocol (MOP)</wordasword>
			is the underlying layer in Groovy which allows you to add methods and properties to an object at runtime.
			Using MOP

		<para>Instances of Groovy object have default implementations of these
			methods, but an Groovy object can override these
			methods. The
			Groovy
			framework calls the methods at runtime if a method or property cannot
			be found. This approach is for
			example used by the Groovy builder
			pattern,
			it pretends to have certain method.
