== Traits

Traits are reusable components of behavior that your classes can
implement, and are an additional Object-Oriented concept alongside
classes and interfaces. Replaced
`@Mixin`.

A trait can have properties, unlike Java 8 default methods for
interfaces.

A class can implements several traits. To avoid multiple
inheritance the last inherited trait wins, unless the class overrides
the method or property directly.

Traits support inheritance, e.g., a trait can extend another
trait
or implement an interface.
