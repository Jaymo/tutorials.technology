== ShellScript

=== Writing a shell script

Shell scripts are short programs that are written in a shell programming language and interpreted by a shell process in the console. 
You can create these programs via a text editor and execute them in a terminal window.

Create for example the following text file.

	<programlisting language="bourne">
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
	parse="text" href="./examples/shell/example.sh" />
	</programlisting>

You also have to make this file executable via:
Create for example the following text file "yourScript".

	<programlisting language="bourne">
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
	parse="text" href="./examples/shell/chmod.txt" />
	</programlisting>


Now you can call the shell script via `./yourScript`.
It should print "Hello, world" to the console.


=== Batch renaming files

The following is an example how to recursively rename all files called "article.xml" to "001_article.xml" from the current home directory.

[source,terminal]
----
include::res/shell/renamefiles.sh[]
----

For to rename all extensions from ".xml" to ".adoc" you can use:

[source,terminal]
----
find . -name "*.xml" -exec rename 's/xml/adoc/;' '{}' \;
