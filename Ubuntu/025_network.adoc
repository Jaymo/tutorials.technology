=== SSH access to the server

The `ssh` command provides secure, encrypted access to a server.
Use `ssh IP-address` or `ssh your_hostname` to access the server.

To upload your public ssh key which allows you to login automatically into a server use the following command.

----
ssh-copy-id youruser@yourserver

[NOTE]

You can also assign a shortname for an IP address via the `config` file in your  `~/.ssh` directory.

For example, to create an alias called _foo_ for the IP address 144.76.74.162 and to use the user called _testing_ switch to
your `~/.ssh` directory, create the  `config` file if it does not exists and enter the following.
