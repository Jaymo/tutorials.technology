=== Add a directory to the path

		
The
`PATH`
environment variable is where the system will look for
executable
files. To temporary add the
`/home/vogella/bin`
directory
to the
`PATH`
use the following command.
		
		
[source,console]
----
include::res/shell/path.sh[]
----
		
		
If you want to add a directory permanently to the path, you can
edit /
create the file
`.bashrc`
and add the following line to
the
file. Every new directory in the path
must start with
`:`.
		

		
[source,console]
----
include::res/path/bash_profile[]
----
		
		
Open a new shell to make the changes in the `.bashrc` file active.
