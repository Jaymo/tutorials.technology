=== Creating a bootable USB disk with unetbootin
		
The default program for creating a bootable USB disk is _Startup Disk Creator_. 
This crashes frequently during the creation of a boot disk. 
The program _unetbootin_ is much more stable. 
You can install it via the following command and start it on the command line.
		
[source,console]

include::res/unity/menu.txt[]

=== Remote xserver
		
The _x2go_ server allows to install a X-server on a remote server and access it via a client from a different machine.
More information can be found on http://wiki.x2go.org/.
