== Exercise: Setup Package Drone

To run Package Drone use:

[source, console]
----
~$ cd /{package-drone-directory}/
~$ ./server
----

By default Package Drone uses `http://localhost:8080/` as URL, which leads to this:

The _Sign in_ link can be found on the right hand side of the web page.

In the console should appear something similar to this:

This _User_ and _Password_ are supposed to be used to sign in for the very first time.

After the login a new user with _Admin_ and _Manager_ rights should be created.

Pressing btn:[Submit] will result in the user overview.

First of all a new password should be generated by clicking the _Change password_ link.
