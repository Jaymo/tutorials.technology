== Exercise: Using Aspects

So called _Aspects_ can be applied to a _Channel_ like this:

In the _Channel aspects_ section additional _Aspects_ can be added.

Default categories of additional _Aspects_:

* Debian
* Maven
* OSGi
* Other
* RPM

=== Exercise: The P2 Repository Aspect

When OSGi bundles have been added to a channel, it is usually helpful to provide these bundles as p2 update site.
For example when bundles and features should be provided for a Maven Tycho build, which only works with p2 update sites.

Package Drone has the capability to automatically generate a p2 update site by using the _P2 Repository Aspect_.

The _P2 Repository Aspect_ can be found in the OSGi category of the Channel aspects section.

The _P2 Repository_ Aspect requires the _Hasher_ and _Mine_ Aspect.
But when pressing on the btn:[Add] button, one can confirm to btn:[Add with dependencies], to also add the _Hasher_ and _Mine_ Aspect.

The p2 update site for this _Channel_ be accessed with this URL schema: {server}:{port}/p2/{channel-id}, e.g., 

....
http://localhost:8080/p2/828d10a6-c682-4d56-9d68-74dfe6dbb1e4/
....


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not add the _Tycho Cleaner_ or the _P2 Meta Data Generator_ Aspect, otherwise these Aspects would interfere with the _P2 Repository_ Aspect and cause invalid results.
