When btn:[Finish] is pressed a setup Eclipse IDE containing the Package Drone project is available.

After starting the Eclipse IDE there will be a _runtime_ project to setup the target platform.

There are two ways to download the libs for the target definition:

* Run the _build.ant_ build file of the _runtime_ project with Apache Ant
* Run a `mvn clean install` build with Apache Maven in the _runtime_ folder on the _pom.xml_

After that the target definition file can be used to set the target platform.
