		<wordasword>FreeMarker</wordasword>
		is a Java-based template engine which can be used in
		stand-alone or
		servlet-based Java programs.
	
	
		In
		FreeMarker
		you define templates, which are text files that contain
		the desired output,
		except that they contain placeholders like
		<code>${name}</code>
		, and even some
		logic like conditionals, loops, etc. In your Java program
		you
		supply the actual
		values for these placeholders
		and the final
		output is
		generated based on
		this input.
	
	
		The input of templates is a bunch of named variables that you usually
		provide
		as a
		<code>Map&lt;String, Object></code>
		(the
		<code>Map</code>
		entries will be
		the variables) or as a JavaBean (the JavaBean
		properties will be the
		variables).
		The variable values can be simple
		strings, numbers and such primitive
		values,
		but also lists, maps, or
		arbitrary Java objects whose methods
		you can call from the template.
		Note that when accessing JavaBean
		properties,
		<code>myObject.myProperty</code>
		syntax should be used instead of
		<code>myObject.getMyProperty()</code>
		.
	
	
		The output of templates is written into a
		<code>Writer</code>
		that you provide,
		so it can go into a HTTP response (for dynamic web
		pages), into a local
		file,
		into a
		<code>String</code>
		, etc.
	
	
		It is configurable from where FreeMarker reads the templates;
		commonly
		used options are
		loading from a file-system directory,
		from the
		class-path, from
		the servlet context (
		<code>WEB-INF/templates</code>
		or such),
		or even from a database table.
		It's also possible to "load"
		templates directly from
		<code>String</code>
		objects.
