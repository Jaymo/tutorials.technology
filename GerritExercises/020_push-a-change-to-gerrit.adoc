== Push a change to Gerrit

In this exercise you learns how to push a change to the Gerrit
code review system.

=== Create a new commit for Gerrit

Create a new commit based on a branch to which also 'origin/master' points. 
Make sure the 'Compute Change-Id for Gerrit Code Review' button in the commit dialog is selected when you commit the changes. 
This creates the 'Change-Id: ...' footer in the commit message which is necessary for the Gerrit Code Review.

'I0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' is just a placeholder for the Change-Id. 
The actual Change-Id is generated and inserted during the commit operation.

=== Pushing to Gerrit

Right click the Git repository node in the Git Repositories view and chose the 'Push to Upstream' command from the context menu:

If you are pushing over HTTP you are asked to provide user and
password (if not configured already):

After the change is pushed the confirmation dialog will appear:

From the confirmation dialog we see the URL under which the change is
exposed in Gerrit. We also see that the numerical ID of the change is
'41480' in this case.

=== Check your change in Gerrit

Copy the link from the confirmation dialog to the clipboard and paste into you web browser

* *OR* simply open link:https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/status:open,n,z[See all open Gerrit reviews] in
  your web browser and find your change in the list of open changes.
  Usually, it is the one on the top as the entries are sorted by time
  of last update. Click on the change to get to the change details.

* Get familiar with the information Gerrit displays on the change
  page. The change contains one patch set on its creation. A patch set
  corresponds to one Git commit.
* Click on a file to see the Side-by-Side diff.

'Q:' Compare the local commit SHA1 and the SHA1 of the Patch Set 1.
Are they the same?
